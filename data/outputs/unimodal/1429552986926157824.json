        "- On March 23, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act , the partner piece of legislation to the February 28 Decree for the Protection of People and State. The Enabling Act assigned all legislative power to Hitler and his ministers, thus securing their ability to control the political apparatus. When President Hindenburg died in August 1934, Hitler wrote a new law that combined the offices of president and chancellor. It was sanctioned by a national plebiscite .

        "- The Nazis aligned with other right-leaning factions and gradually worked their way up to 33 percent of the vote \u2014but were unable to reach a full majority. In January 1933, Hindenburg reluctantly appointed Hitler as chancellor on the advice of Franz von Papen, a disgruntled former chancellor who believed the conservative bourgeois parties should ally with the Nazis to keep the Communists out of power.

        "- The assault by pro-Trump extremists on January 6 was not just an attack on the United States Capitol but an attack on the United States and our democracy. After President Trump and his supporters spent months spreading lies and propaganda about the election, President Trump\u2019s supporters attempted to stage a coup and overturn the results of our free and fair presidential election and end our democracy as we know it.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is partially misinformed. While it's true that Hitler's attempted coup in 1923 failed and he later took over Germany, it's not accurate to say that no one was held accountable. Hitler was jailed for his failed Beer Hall Putsch in 1923 and used legal channels to attain power later on (https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/true-story-reichstag-fire-and-nazis-rise-power-180962240/). As for Trump, he was impeached for a second time by the House of Representatives for incitement of insurrection following the January 6 attack on the Capitol (https://adamsmith.house.gov/2021/1/rep-smith-statement-on-passage-of-article-of-impeachment-charging-trump-with-incitement-of-capitol-insurrection). However, the Senate did not convict him, which is likely what the tweet is referring to when it says Trump faces no consequences.",

Inciting an insurrection in an attempt to maintain power warrants the immediate impeachment of President Trump, also ensuring his disqualification from holding any public office in the future.
