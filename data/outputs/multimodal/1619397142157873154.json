        "- The Russian embassy in Berlin said the decision - which paves the way for other NATO members also to send German-made tanks - would escalate the 11-month conflict in Ukraine, which Moscow casts increasingly as a perilous face-off between Russia and the U.S.-led alliance.

Germany has not declared war on Russia, but has approved the delivery of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, which Russia has criticized (https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-slams-german-tank-decision-escalation-conflict-betrayal-history-2023-01-25/). The claim that Ukraine was not attacked is also incorrect. Kyiv and its Western allies have described Russia's actions as an unprovoked war of aggression (https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-slams-german-tank-decision-escalation-conflict-betrayal-history-2023-01-25/). The UN Charter allows for self-defense in the event of an armed attack (https://www.csis.org/analysis/ukraines-need-fighter-jets-under-un-charter-and-responsibility-protect), and the General Assembly has deplored Russia's aggression against Ukraine (https://www.csis.org/analysis/ukraines-need-fighter-jets-under-un-charter-and-responsibility-protect).",
