        "- In an extraordinary move during otherwise secret negotiations, Blinken revealed publicly in July that the U.S. had made a \u201csubstantial proposal\u201d to Russia for Griner and Whelan. Though he did not specify the terms, people familiar with it said the U.S. had offered Bout.

        "- As we noted earlier, in his press conference on Aug. 31, Biden said troops had facilitated the evacuation of about 5,500 Americans before the last American troops left. \u201cNow we believe that about 100 to 200 Americans remain in Afghanistan with some intention to leave,\u201d he said.

        "- \u201cThere is no deadline,\u201d Biden said. But with its forces withdrawn, the U.S. is left with diplomatic persuasion instead of military muscle to get the Taliban extremists who\u2019ve been fighting the U.S. for 20 years to give remaining Americans safe passage out.

        "- Besides the efforts of U.S. officials, the release also followed months of backchannel negotiations involving Bill Richardson, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and a frequent emissary in hostage talks, and his top deputy Mickey Bergman. The men had made multiple trips abroad in the last year to discuss swap scenarios with Russian contacts.

        "- U.S. officials said diplomats are in talks with neighboring countries and others to try to arrange non-U.S.-military evacuations for those remaining. Among the options, if the diplomacy works, are potential charter flights from the airport when it re-opens and overland routes.

        "- Despite Biden\u2019s and Blinken\u2019s assurances that the U.S. will continue to work to help Americans leave, the withdrawal of all U.S. troops before every American who wanted to leave was evacuated means Biden went back on a promise he made in an Aug. 18 ABC News interview. Biden said then that U.S. troops would stay beyond Aug. 31, if necessary.

        "- Biden plans to travel to Kentucky on Monday.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is misleading. While it's true that Paul Whelan, a Marine veteran, remains detained in Russia, it's not accurate to say he was \"left behind enemy lines\" by Biden. Whelan was detained in Russia since 2018, before Biden's presidency. The Biden administration has been actively working to secure his release, as evidenced by the negotiations for a prisoner swap involving Whelan. The term \"stranded\" also implies abandonment, which is not the case here. The U.S. government has classified Whelan as wrongfully detained and has been making efforts for his release. \nhttps://www.federaltimes.com/home/2022/12/08/wnba-star-freed-in-us-russia-prisoner-swap-marine-veteran-still-held/",

        "- Whelan has been held in Russia since December 2018. The U.S. government also classified him as wrongfully detained. He was sentenced in 2020 to 16 years in prison. Whelan was not included in the Reed prisoner swap, escalating pressure on the Biden administration to ensure that any deal that brought home Griner also included him.

        "- Secretary of State Antony Blinken also has said that there are less than 200 Americans the U.S. still needs to get out of the country. \u201cWe believe there are still a small number of Americans, under 200 and likely closer to 100, who remain in Afghanistan and want to leave. We\u2019re trying to determine exactly how many,\u201d Blinken said in an Aug. 30 speech .

        "- Even so, the fact that the deal was a one-for-one swap was a surprise given that U.S. officials had for months expressed their their determination to bring home both Griner and Paul Whelan, a Michigan corporate security executive and Marine veteran jailed in Russia since 2018 on espionage charges that his family and the U.S. government has said are baseless.
