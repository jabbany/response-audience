        "- We cannot leave people and communities behind as they still stagger to pick up the pieces from disastrous floods, wildfires, and hurricanes. Not one Florida Republican in Congress who was present, voted to put the interests of those suffering from tragedy above their own political fortunes.

        "- When Hurricane Ian hit Florida, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican, joined Florida\u2019s full congressional delegation in signing a letter to President Joe Biden seeking a major disaster declaration, which allows for temporary aid. Gov. Ron DeSantis, also a Republican, sent Biden a similar letter.

But if lawmakers want to provide more relief, they will need to pass supplemental appropriations.
