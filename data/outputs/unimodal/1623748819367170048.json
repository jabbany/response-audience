        "- When DeJoy first took office, the postmaster general led an effort to slash tens of thousands of non-union jobs by offering early retirement incentives and layoffs as part of a reorganization of its management structure. He subsequently said he might have to add 100,000 employees to support the Postal Service\u2019s growing package business.

        "- The reduction would reverse a trend in recent years in which the USPS workforce has remained steady or grown slightly. The Postal Service ended 2021 with nearly 517,000 career employees, its highest total since 2012. The non-career workforce has remained fairly steady in recent years at 136,000. Part of the growth was due to a concerted effort under DeJoy to convert tens of thousands of non-career workers , who earn less money and fewer benefits, into career roles to reduce the high rates of attrition USPS has experienced.

        "- In recent public remarks, DeJoy -- who has donated millions of dollars to Republican causes and whom Trump once called \"a friend of mine\" -- has repeatedly indicated that he has no intention of stepping down, pledging before the election to see his cost-cutting initiatives through \"no matter who is president,\" and laying out plans for the future of the beleaguered mail agency at a Postal Service board meeting earlier this month.

        "- Since he started in the job June 15, DeJoy has launched a series of organizational shake-ups that have attracted bipartisan criticism that the changes would delay mail delivery just as more Americans are expected to vote by mail. Earlier this month, he announced an \"organizational realignment\" at the agency, which lost $9 billion last year. These changes included a reduction in employee overtime hours and the elimination of postal-sorting machines.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is partially misinformed. While it's true that Louis DeJoy has plans to reduce USPS positions, it's not a direct job cut but rather a reduction through voluntary early retirements and expected attrition over the next few years. The aim is to reach a break-even point for USPS, which has been facing financial difficulties. The number of positions to be reduced represents only a quarter of the attrition the agency expects to see over a similar period. DeJoy has also stated that USPS will remain in a hiring posture in the coming years. As for why DeJoy still holds his position, the Postmaster General is not a political appointee and cannot be removed by a president. The power to remove the Postmaster General lies with the Postal Service's governing board, whose members were all appointed by President Trump. \n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.govexec.com/workforce/2022/07/usps-plans-slash-50000-positions-coming-years-reach-break-even-point/375096/\nhttps://abcnews.go.com/Politics/controversial-postal-chief-poised-remain-biden-administration/story?id=74469137\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/us-postal-service-will-offer-early-retirements-consolidate-postal-districts-2021-03-03/",
