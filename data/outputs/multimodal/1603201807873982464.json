    "correction_response": "This tweet is potentially misleading. Elon Musk's stance on doxxing policy is consistent with his actions. After buying Twitter, Musk clarified his stance on doxxing, stating that real-time posting of someone's location violates policy, but delayed posting is acceptable. This was in response to an account tracking his private jet in real-time, which he viewed as a personal safety risk. Twitter suspended the account, reinstated it, and then suspended it again for violating its policy on sharing live location information. Musk's son was mistakenly followed due to this account, leading to Musk's decision. \nReferences: \nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/douggollan/2022/12/14/elon-musk-vows-legal-action-against-trackers-clarifies-private-jet-doxxing-policy/\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-suspends-bot-account-tracking-elon-musks-jet-2022-12-14/",
