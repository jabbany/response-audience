        "- PPP loans were a first-of-their-kind tool to help small businesses receive federally backed cash-flow assistance. If the business used the money to maintain payroll, the portion of the loans used for covered payroll costs, interest on mortgage obligations, rent, and utilities would be forgiven.

While it's true that a company in which Matt Gaetz holds stock, Caregivers Inc., received a PPP loan, it's not accurate to say that Gaetz himself had the loan forgiven.
