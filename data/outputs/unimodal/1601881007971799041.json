        "- Patients with cancer face difficult decisions regarding treatment and the possibility of trading quality of life (QoL) for length of life (LoL). Little information is available regarding patients' preferences and attitudes toward their cancer treatment and the personal costs they are prepared to exchange to extend their life. The aim of this review is to determine the complex trade\u2010offs and underpinning factors that make patients with cancer choose quality over quantity of life.

        "- In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, oncologists will need to weigh the risks of death and morbidity from COVID-19 against the magnitude of benefit of intended cancer therapies. Early estimates from China suggest an overall case fatality rate of 2%, increasing to 8% for 70\u201379 year-olds, and 15% for those \u226580 years of age 1 . Case fatality rates are also markedly higher among patients with comorbidities: 11% for cardiovascular disease, 7% for diabetes, 6% for chronic respiratory disease, and 6% for cancer. Case fatality rates were far lower outside of Hubei province (0.4% versus 2.9% in Hubei), therefore, these estimates might be high. For many patients with cancer, the probable survival benefits of receiving treatment still far outweigh the risks of death from COVID-19.

        "- Cancer is now understood to be primarily as a disease that can be managed. However, there are also challenges we have to face in order to make sure that cancer does not become an epidemic like COVID-19 in coming years. The cancer management needs to be tackled in a coordinated way, and in this one team project, \u2018prevention\u2019 shouldn\u2019t be a bystander.

        "- The act substantially increased funding for cancer research, but its outlays were hardly lavish and barely kept up with rising inflation during the 1970s. Its framers sought to appeal to those who favored prevention over research by including a provision to establish seventeen comprehensive cancer centers, which screened and treated patients and disseminated information about the disease.

        "- In cancer treatment, patients are often required to make trade\u2010offs between QoL and length of life (LoL). 6 Tumor\u2010specific therapy can potentially prolong life; however, this may reduce QoL significantly. Some patients are willing to endure toxicities associated with treatment in order to increase their LoL, while others value QoL more and are reluctant to spend their remaining years in a compromised state.

        "- The current pandemic raises two fundamental patient safety issues. First, patients with cancer must leave their homes to visit the cancer clinic and thereby possibly expose themselves to infection. Second, cancer treatments themselves can predispose patients to the more serious harmful effects of COVID-19. Should patients risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in order to receive treatment for cancer? The available evidence is limited, but suggests that the symptoms of COVID-19 are probably more severe in patients with cancer than for those without. Clear evidence exists that older age and higher levels of comorbidity are associated with more severe COVID-19 symptoms and adverse outcomes; this consideration is highly relevant to patients with cancer 3 , 4 .

        "- The act was widely supported by Congress, and marked the high point of Lasker's influence. Many scientists, however, spoke of \"Mrs. Lasker's war\" and criticized her for promising more than science at its present state could deliver. Turning the analogy of the moon landing on its head, the director of Columbia University's Institute of Cancer Research, Sol Spiegelman, averred that \"an all-out effort at this time [to find a cure for cancer] would be like trying to land a man on the moon without knowing Newton's laws of gravity.\" Reference: https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/spotlight/tl/feature/cancer published on 2019-03-13 12:15:57",
        "- The war on cancer that has been fighting many of the wrong battles with wrong weapons is largely futile. The return on investment is not impressive.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is partially misinformed. While it's true that cancer treatment has been a challenge and the focus on a \"cure\" has been criticized, it's not accurate to say that the science to cure cancer is already here. Cancer is a complex disease with many forms and its basic biological mechanisms remain largely unknown. The current approach is to manage cancer rather than completely eradicate it. Furthermore, even the most recent treatments fail to completely eliminate the tumor, which often relapses and becomes more malignant. Therefore, the claim that we already have the cure for cancer is misleading. \n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8749321/\nhttps://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/spotlight/tl/feature/cancer",

        "- Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, theories about the origins of cancer abounded, ranging from the hypothesis that it was a \"disease of civilization\"--that it arose from the emotional stresses, neuroses, and chemical products of modern life--to investigations of cancer-causing viruses and environmental carcinogens, namely toxins and nuclear radiation.
