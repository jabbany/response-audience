        "- Rittenhouse, according to his attorneys, answered \"his patriotic and civil duty to serve\" when an online call was put out by a former Kenosha city alderman for \"patriots\" to take up arms and help protect lives and property in the city against looting and rioting that occurred in August 2020.

        "- Rittenhouse has emerged as a divisive figure, with politics coursing through the case. He is a hero to some conservatives who believe in unfettered gun rights and see the shootings as justified during the Kenosha chaos. Many on the left see Rittenhouse as a symbol of an American gun culture run amok.

Despite the wealth of evidence detailing the ways it manifests, greater understanding is necessary.

        "- Kenosha officials did not indicate that at a news conference Wednesday. Lake County, Illinois, records suggest that at least one death will be charged as first-degree intentional homicide, which carries a mandatory life sentence. The case could resolve in a lesser charge through plea bargaining. Rittenhouse could face a reckless homicide charge in the second death that, according to video, appears to be in reaction to an attack.

        "- From the outset, Rosenbaum, 36, was portrayed as a menacing, violent actor. A convicted child molester, he was described by various witnesses as threatening Rittenhouse and others and engaging in random violence. At one point, Rosenbaum pushed a burning dumpster into a police cruiser with officers inside. Prosecutors tried to rehabilitate him, with disastrous results. They called Richard McGinnis, a journalist who was next to Rittenhouse when he shot Rosenbaum. One prosecutor confronted McGinnis and declared, \u201cYou have no idea what Mr. Rosenbaum was thinking at any point of his life. You have never been inside his head. You never met him before.\u201d McGinnis shrugged and said he \u201cnever exchanged words with him, if that\u2019s what your question is.\u201d The prosecutor then pressed further, saying McGinnis had no idea what Rosenbaum was thinking because it \u201cis complete guesswork, isn\u2019t it?\u201d McGinnis dr yily responded, \u201cWell, he said, \u2018F\u2013k you\u2019 and reached for [Rittenhouse\u2019s] weapon.\u201d Reference: https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/581411-rittenhouse-trial-perils-of-weighing-public-opinion-over-evidence/ published on 2021-11-13 15:30:09",

        "- When juxtaposing what feels like a never-ending pattern of police brutality against Black people with the treatment of white perpetrators, there is an obvious disparity that highlights the pervasive nature of systemic racism. White gunmen who commit heinous crimes are often treated differently, with police being able to apprehend white suspects and bring them safely into custody.
