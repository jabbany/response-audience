        "- Reuters fact-checked a similar claim about COVID-19 vaccines genetically modifying humans, which they rated as false. Reuters interviewed Mark Lynas, a visiting fellow at Cornell University\u2019s Alliance for Science group, who said no vaccine can genetically modify human DNA. \u201cThat\u2019s just a myth, one often spread intentionally by anti-vaccination activists to deliberately generate confusion and mistrust,\u201d Lynas told Reuters. \u201cGenetic modification would involve the deliberate insertion of foreign DNA into the nucleus of a human cell, and vaccines simply don\u2019t do that.\u201d Reference: https://www.poynter.org/tfcn/2020/fact-check-will-a-covid-19-vaccine-alter-your-dna/ published on 2020-10-15 21:36:21",
        "- Among that group are people who say the vaccine is the \u201cMark of the Beast.\u201d The phrase \u201cMark of the Beast\u201d can be found in the chapter of Revelation in the Bible. Some Christians believe if they get the vaccine, they will be marked for hell, but some pastors are trying to stop those rumors.

        "- There is a well-known practice in the ancient world called \u201cgematria,\u201d in which letters are assigned numerical values. This allows authors to refer to individuals by using \u201cthe number of their name,\u201d rather than their actual name. And biblical scholars have long noted that in Hebrew characters, the numerical value of Nero\u2019s formal title \u2013 Caesar Nero \u2013 is 666.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is misinformed. The COVID-19 vaccines do not contain the \"Mark of the Beast\" as stated by Hennepin Healthcare and supported by Pastor Jamie Strickler. The idea that the mark of the beast is the vaccination is not scripturally rooted anywhere in the valid translation of Christian history. Luciferase, which the tweet mentions, is a harmless enzyme used to study cell activities and does not cause significant changes to cell metabolism. It's also important to note that mRNA vaccines do not alter human DNA.

        "- Finally, let\u2019s look into mRNA. According to NIH\u2019s National Cancer Institute , mRNA (also known as messenger RNA) carries genetic information from the DNA in the nucleus of a cell to the cytoplasm where proteins are made. mRNA is naturally created in the human body, and it\u2019s harmless. The tweet is likely referring to the use of synthetic mRNA as a vaccine. We read up on this as well and found several key points, explained well in this fact-check from the Associated Press . First, the use of mRNA vaccines does have complications that scientists are still researching. But most importantly, it is simply not true that mRNA vaccines alter human DNA in any way.
