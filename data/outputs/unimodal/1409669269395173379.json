        "- The risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fully vaccinated people cannot be completely eliminated as long as there is continued community transmission of the virus. Early data suggest infections in fully vaccinated persons are more commonly observed with the Delta variant than with other SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, data show fully vaccinated persons are less likely than unvaccinated persons to acquire SARS-CoV-2, and infections with the Delta variant in fully vaccinated persons are associated with less severe clinical outcomes.

        "- Available evidence suggests the currently approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against hospitalization and death for a variety of strains, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2); data suggest lower effectiveness against confirmed infection and symptomatic disease caused by the Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants compared with the ancestral strain and Alpha variant. Ongoing monitoring of vaccine effectiveness against variants is needed.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is potentially misleading. As of the tweet's date, the CDC was not recommending boosters, stating there was not yet significant evidence of declining protection from the vaccines. Experts also advised J&J recipients to wait for more data unless Delta variant-driven infections and hospitalizations increase significantly. While some individuals may be taking an additional dose, it's important to note that this is without published data on the safety and effectiveness of combining different vaccines. The FDA has approved mRNA vaccines for use, but this does not imply a recommendation for J&J recipients to take an additional dose. The CDC considers people fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving the J&J vaccine. \nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/booster-may-be-needed-jj-shot-delta-variant-spreads-some-experts-already-taking-2021-06-25/\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/fully-vaccinated-people.html",

This vaccine is also authorized under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to be administered to prevent COVID-19 in persons aged 12-15 years. A second mRNA vaccine (Moderna), as well as a recombinant, replication-incompetent adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vector vaccine (Janssen vaccine [Johnson & Johnson]) are authorized under an EUA for use in persons aged \u226518 years. Both mRNA vaccines are also authorized for administration of an additional dose to certain immunocompromised persons.
