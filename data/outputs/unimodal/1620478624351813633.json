        "- Income. Households at the top of the income distribution received significantly more income than households at the bottom. Between 1979 and 2018, average income, both before and after means-tested transfers and federal taxes, grew for all quintiles (or fifths) of the distribution, but it increased most among households in the highest quintile.

        "- In fact, most of the top Reagan administration officials didn\u2019t think the tax cut would pay for itself. They were counting on spending cuts to avoid blowing up the deficit. But they never materialized. Reference: https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-we-learned-from-reagans-tax-cuts/ published on 2017-12-08 00:00:00",
        "- Income Inequality. Income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficients for income both before and after transfers and taxes, rose between 1979 and 2018. (The Gini coefficient is a standard measure of income inequality that summarizes an entire distribution in a single number that ranges from zero to one.) The degree to which transfers and taxes reduced income inequality over that same period increased. Reference: https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57404 published on 2021-08-05 00:00:00",
        "- The most appropriate test of the revenue impact of the TCJA is to compare actual revenues in FY2018 with predicted revenues in FY2018 assuming Congress had not passed the legislation. In fact, the actual amount of revenue collected in FY2018 was significantly lower than the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s (CBO) projection of FY2018 revenue made in January 2017\u2014before the tax cuts were signed into law in December 2017. The shortfall was $275 billion, or 7.6% of revenues that were expected before the tax cuts took place. Given that the economy grew, and in the absence of another policy that could have caused a large revenue loss, the data imply that the TCJA substantially reduced revenues (Figure 1).

        "- When Ronald Reagan arrived in Washington in 1981, circumstances were very different than they are today. Inflation was nearly 10 percent. The Federal Reserve had pushed interest rates into double digits. The federal debt was about half what it is today, measured as a share of the economy.

        "- These effects are accentuated if one looks at taxes as a share of GDP (Table 1). In 2017, before the tax cuts were considered, the CBO estimated that total revenues would be 18.1% of GDP in FY2018. With the TCJA, revenues were only 16.4% of GDP. Similar patterns hold for individual income taxes and (in more extreme form) for corporate income taxes. Due to data limitations, the revenue numbers in Table 1 are on a fiscal year (October 2017\u2013September 2018) basis. As a result, 2018 data include the three months prior to the act\u2019s enactment. If the values were instead on a calendar year basis so that 2018 only included post-TCJA revenues, the revenue declines would be even larger.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is partially correct. Tax cuts, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, have indeed led to a decline in government revenue. The TCJA reduced the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and also reduced income taxes for most Americans, leading to a significant shortfall in projected revenues (https://www.brookings.edu/articles/did-the-2017-tax-cut-the-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-pay-for-itself/). However, the claim that the 400 richest American families paid a tax rate of 3.4 percent between 2014-2018 is not supported by the provided facts. While tax rates have generally fallen across the income distribution, higher-income households still paid a higher average federal tax rate than lower-income households (https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57404).",

        "- The TCJA\u2019s changes mostly affected the corporate and individual income taxes (Figure 2). The act reduced the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%\u2014a 40% reduction. Actual corporate income tax revenue in FY2018 was $135 billion lower than CBO\u2019s projection from 2017\u2014almost exactly a 40% decline. The most recent CBO projections estimate further decreases in corporate tax revenue. The TCJA also reduced income taxes for most Americans , which led to a decline in revenues relative to prior projections. For individual income taxes, actual collections in FY2018 were $97 billion, or 5.4%, below pre-TCJA projections.

        "- As projections for the deficit worsened, it became clear that the 1981 tax cut was too big. So with Reagan\u2019s signature, Congress undid a good chunk of the 1981 tax cut by raising taxes a lot in 1982, 1983, 1984 and 1987. George H.W. Bush signed another tax increase in 1990 and Bill Clinton did the same in 1993. Reference: https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-we-learned-from-reagans-tax-cuts/ published on 2017-12-08 00:00:00"
