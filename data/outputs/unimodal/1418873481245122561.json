        "- The NIV 2011 seems to have taken that criticism into account and come up with a compromise: \"Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.\" Reference: https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna42138347 published on 2011-03-17 21:23:10",

        "- In the New Testament, Jesus also presents himself in feminine language. In Matthew\u2019s Gospel , Jesus stands over Jerusalem and weeps, saying, \u201cJerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing.\u201d Reference: https://theconversation.com/what-the-early-church-thought-about-gods-gender-100077 published on 2018-08-01 00:00:00",

        "- First, inclusive translations abolish many gender-specific terms. For example, they may change \u201cfather\u201d to \u201cparent,\u201d \u201cson\u201d to \u201cchild,\u201d and \u201cman\u201d to \u201cmortal.\u201d And second, these translations added words and phrases not found in ancient manuscripts for the sake of inclusion. A common example is the translation of \u201cbrother\u201d as \u201cbrother or sister.\u201d Reference: https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/southern-baptists-embrace-gender-inclusive-language-in-the-bible/529935/ published on 2017-06-11 18:46:20",

    "correction_response": "This tweet is misinformed. The Bible does contain pronouns, including those referring to God. For instance, the 2011 translation of the New International Version Bible refers to God as \"He\" and \"the Father\" (https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna42138347). Moreover, the Bible uses both masculine and feminine language to describe God, as seen in Exodus 3 where God's name, Yahweh, combines both female and male grammatical endings (https://theconversation.com/what-the-early-church-thought-about-gods-gender-100077). The Bible also uses gender-neutral language in some translations (https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/southern-baptists-embrace-gender-inclusive-language-in-the-bible/529935/).",
