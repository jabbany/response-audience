        "- The Complaint makes the baseless claim that I violated House Rule XXIII, clause 1. I swore an oath to uphold and defend the United States Constitution. Our Constitution is the cornerstone of our Republic and I strive every day to uphold my promise. My objections to the counting of Electoral College votes in Arizona and Pennsylvania were based on the Constitution and changes to state law that were not made by the state legislature, not election fraud. Similar objections have been made related to previous elections, including in 2001, 2005, and 2017, all by Democrats. (See examples attached as Exhibit A ). I have publicly condemned the violence that occurred on January 6, 2021, and I firmly support the rule of law. I strive to behave at all times in a manner that reflects creditably on the House of Representatives and that represents the people of Colorado\u2019s Third Congressional District and makes them proud.

        "- The general allegations are that I was involved \u201cin instigating and aiding the violent riot at the Capitol Building on January 6, 2021\u201d and that I \u201cendangered fellow Members\u2019 lives and pursued a disinformation campaign related to the election results that resulted in an armed uprising.\u201d To be clear, I was not involved in instigating and aiding the riots that took place on January 6th at the U.S. Capitol and there is no evidence that would support further investigation of these unjustified, politically motivated claims. As previously mentioned, my objections to the counting of Electoral College votes in Arizona and Pennsylvania were based on the Constitution and changes to state law that were not made by the state legislature, not election fraud.

David Trone, who was evacuated from the House chamber (tweet here ) both discussed the experience. While their tweets do not prove that the instructions to avoid social media were given by security, the tweets were published less than an hour after Boebert's.

While Lauren Boebert did tweet about Nancy Pelosi's evacuation from the House chamber during the Capitol events, she did not disclose Pelosi's specific location. Boebert's tweets were concurrent with live TV broadcasts, which were also reporting Pelosi's evacuation.

I tweeted that we were locked in the House Chambers and that the Speaker left during the lockdown.
