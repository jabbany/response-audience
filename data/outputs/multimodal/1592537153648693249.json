        "- Samadi first takes a history to find out what may be responsible for the ED. \u201cShame and guilt may play a role if someone is watching lot of pornography, so I always talk to the individuals separately,\u201d he said.

        "- Treatment is similar to a 12-step recovery program, he said. It starts with a 4- to 6-week plan to desensitize certain receptors in the brain. Talk therapy also helps address some of the underlying issues. \u201cWe also encourage men spend more time with a partner,\" he said. \"We try to have [partners] touch one another, reconnect, and slowly build the relationship back up.\u201d Reference: https://www.everydayhealth.com/news/erection-problems-this-habit-may-why/ published on 2014-02-04 00:00:00",

    "correction_response": "This tweet is partially accurate but could be misleading. While it's true that excessive porn consumption can lead to issues like desensitization to sex and erectile dysfunction, it's not universally damaging to all young men. Some people can have a healthy relationship with porn, and the consequences vary widely among individuals. It's also important to note that overcoming addiction and transforming one's life requires time, consistency, and perseverance. The tweet's implication of a 4-year transformation might give the impression that change is quick, which can be misleading. \n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.menshealth.com/health/a32376309/porn-and-sex-addiction-recovery-transformation-mental-health/\nhttps://www.everydayhealth.com/news/erection-problems-this-habit-may-why/",

        "- All in all, I don't think porn is evil, and it might even be possible for some people to have a healthy relationship to porn. But my mission is about helping people understand that, whether they're aware of it or not, porn has consequences on your life, and your mind. And for those of us who have developed addictions to it, those consequences can be more serious.
