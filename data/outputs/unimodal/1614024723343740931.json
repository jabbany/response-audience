Nineteen analytical studies were found but there were inconsistent conclusions for BNT162b2 as two studies suggested a potentially increased risk of thromboembolic events after vaccination, one study suggested an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke and the remainder reported no association between BNT162b2 and these outcomes. No published articles were found reporting significant risk of thromboembolic events nor hemorrhagic stroke after CoronaVac vaccination, and limited published articles explored the safety effects after both first and second doses.

        "- This is the first population-based study on the safety effect of thromboembolic events and hemorrhagic stroke after both doses of BNT162b2 and CoronaVac among the Chinese population. The modified self-control case series study showed an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke after both first and second doses of BNT162b2 but not after CoronaVac. No increased risk was observed for thromboembolic events for both vaccines; whilst the incidences among those vaccinated are lower than that in SARS-CoV-2 test positive cases.

While a safety monitoring system flagged a potential link between Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine and a type of brain stroke in older adults, it's important to note that this is based on preliminary data and requires further investigation. Pfizer, BioNTech, the CDC, and the FDA have not observed similar findings in other monitoring systems, both in the U.S. and globally.
