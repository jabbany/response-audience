    "correction_response": "This tweet is partially accurate but lacks context. It's true that Elon Musk, who recently joined Twitter's board of directors, had a Twitter spat with a U.S. Senator and has legally paid $0 in federal income taxes in certain years, as have other billionaires. This is due to U.S. tax laws that allow the ultra-rich to avoid income tax on wealth derived from assets until they are sold. However, it's also important to note that Musk's tax bill for 2021 could exceed $10 billion due to exercising stock options, and he has claimed to be contributing more than any other U.S. citizen this year. \n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax\nhttps://fortune.com/2021/12/15/freeloader-senator-karen-elon-musk-elizabeth-warren-twitter-spat-taxes/\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/elon-musk-join-twitters-board-directors-rcna22984\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-name-top-shareholder-musk-board-2022-04-05/",
