    "correction_response": "This tweet is potentially misleading. While it's true that the Biden administration has taken steps to mitigate inflation, such as passing the Ocean Shipping Reform Act and the Lower Food & Fuel Costs Act, it's not accurate to attribute inflation solely to Putin's war against Ukraine. Inflation was already a concern due to factors like the Democrats' COVID \"stimulus\" spending and increased demand from excess savings before the conflict in Ukraine began. The administration initially dismissed inflation as \"transitory\" before attributing it to external factors. \nReferences: \nhttps://waysandmeans.house.gov/fact-check-its-bidenflation-not-putinflation/\nhttps://pelosi.house.gov/media-center/pelosi-updates/lowering-costs-for-working-families",
