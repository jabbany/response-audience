        "- The Texas Department of Health and Human Services has removed resources for LGBTQ+ youths from its suicide prevention website. And Texas Children\u2019s Hospital \u2014 the largest pediatric hospital in the nation \u2014 announced Friday that it will no longer provide gender-affirming treatments in light of the policy directive. Full implementation of the Texas policy would further undermine this essential medical care by arbitrarily defining it as child abuse and requiring professionals who deal with children to separate them from those healthy supports \u2014 thus doing the opposite of what the standard of care requires.

        "- Research finds that gender-affirming care and family support can reduce suicidal ideation for trans and nonbinary children. While trans and nonbinary children have higher rates of depression and suicidality than their cisgender peers, studies demonstrate that when trans youths have supportive networks, their rates of depression do not differ from their peers \u2014 lowering their mental health risks.

        "- New, in-depth analysis of interviews with nearly 3,000 Texans finds strong majority support across a broad range of subgroups for laws that would protecting lesbian, gay, transgender, and bisexual people from discrimination in jobs, public accommodations and housing.

        "- The new analysis also finds that nearly six in ten (57 percent) Texans oppose allowing a small business owner to refuse to provide products or services to gay or lesbian people based on the owner\u2019s religious beliefs. Majorities of most Texas subgroups, with the notable exceptions of white evangelical Protestants and Republicans, oppose such religion-based service refusals.

        "- The Trevor Project\u2019s data do not draw any conclusions about the factors behind the results seen in each state, but Ricardo Martinez, CEO of the LGBTQ rights nonprofit Equality Texas, believes there is a direct correlation between the results in Texas and the current social, cultural and political environment.

While it's true that Caroline Cruz, Ted Cruz's daughter, identified herself as 'bi' on social media, there's no public record of her attempting suicide. It's important to respect her privacy and not spread unverified information.
