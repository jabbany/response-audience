        "- As the economy gradually recovers, views are divided on the outlook for inflation. Some commentators point to a federal funds rate of zero and the unprecedented scale of the Fed's intervention in financial markets as policies that will ultimately push inflation higher. Through direct lending and asset purchases, the Fed's outstanding support to the financial sector has, at times, exceeded $1 trillion, compared with less than $1 billion before the financial crisis began. 5 In normal times, such interest rate and lending policies would be expected to be highly inflationary. But as the recession drove down aggregate demand, it put downward pressure on inflation. Other commentators fear that the recession was severe enough that deflation is a greater threat than inflation. They argue that the Fed's intervention in financial markets was necessary to avoid a \"liquidity trap,\" where lower interest rates no longer stimulate interest-sensitive spending.

        "- Using a tool honed during the Great Recession of 2007-09, the Fed offered forward guidance on the future path of interest rates. Initially, it said that it would keep rates near zero \u201cuntil it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.\u201d In September 2020 , reflecting the Fed\u2019s new monetary policy framework , it strengthened that guidance, saying that rates would remain low \u201cuntil labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee\u2019s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.\u201d By the end of 2021, inflation was well above the Fed\u2019s 2% target and labor markets were nearing the Fed\u2019s \u201cmaximum employment\u201d target.

        "- The policy rate is now at the level most Fed officials feel has a neutral economic impact, in effect marking the end of pandemic-era efforts to encourage household and business spending with cheap money. The rate also matches the high point of the central bank's previous tightening cycle from late 2015 to late 2018, a level reached this time in the span of just four months.

        "- In response to a historically high inflation rate and a strong labor market, the Fed began raising interest rates in early 2022. At its June 2022 meeting, the Fed raised its target for the federal funds rate by 0.75 percentage points to a target range of 1.5 to 1.75 percent, its largest single-meeting rate hike since 1994.

        "- The Fed cut its target for the federal funds rate , the rate banks pay to borrow from each other overnight, by a total of 1.5 percentage points at its meetings on March 3 and March 15, 2020. These cuts lowered the funds rate to a range of 0% to 0.25%. The federal funds rate is a benchmark for other short-term rates, and also affects longer-term rates, so this move was aimed at supporting spending by lowering the cost of borrowing for households and businesses.

        "- Although the Fed has brought the federal funds rate down to near zero, because it was only 5.25% when the Fed began reducing rates, the Fed's scope for easing monetary policy through traditional methods was somewhat limited. By contrast, the federal funds rate, although high, was reduced (peak to trough) by 6.8 percentage points in the 1973 recession and by 10.5 percentage points in the 1981 recession.

        "- When nominal interest rates are very low, the Fed has less room to cut interest rates to fight a recession.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is potentially misleading. While it's true that the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has rejected the notion that the U.S. economy is on the cusp of a recession. He explained that U.S. firms continue to hire in excess of 350,000 additional workers each month, indicating a healthy economy. Furthermore, Powell stated that some of the impact of Fed rate increases is still building in the economy, and depending on how inflation responds in the coming months, the central bank could begin to slow the pace of rate increases. Therefore, it's not necessarily accurate to claim that a rate increase would greatly amplify a recession. \nhttps://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-unveil-another-big-rate-hike-signs-economic-slowdown-grow-2022-07-27/",

        "- This dynamic has not been important in the recent recession, as the federal funds rate's recent peak was 5.25% and was reduced before the recession had begun, eventually falling to almost zero. Rising inflation was initially a concern in the current episode, but has never come close to the rates of the 1970s and 1980s\u2014it peaked at 4.2% in the first quarter of 2007. Rising energy and commodity prices were temporarily pushing inflation up in the first half of 2008. Since then, declines in those prices temporarily led to deflation (falling prices) at the end of 2008, with very low inflation since.

        "- Economists often attribute the unusual length and depth of the 1973 and 1981 recessions in part to the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates high. The rate targeted by the Fed, the federal funds rate, peaked at 12.9% in July 1974 and 19% in July 1981. (After adjusting for inflation, these rates were not nearly as high as they appear because inflation was so much higher at the time.) The Fed had raised rates that high in order to reduce inflation, which, as measured in the GDP accounts, peaked at an annualized rate of 12.8% in the third quarter of 1974 and 11.1% in the fourth quarter of 1980. For that reason, some economists have described these recessions as \"made in Washington\"\u2014had the Fed not raised rates so high, they argue, the recessions would presumably have been shorter and milder (although inflationary problems might have worsened).
