        "- People with disabilities Certain groups of people may find it difficult to wear a mask, including people of any age with certain disabilities . Challenges may be caused by being sensitive to materials on the face, difficulty understanding the importance of mask wearing for protection, or having difficulty controlling behavior to keep the mask in place.

        "- Whatever product you choose, it should provide a good fit (i.e., fitting closely on the face without any gaps along the edges or around the nose) and be comfortable enough when worn properly (covering your nose and mouth) so that you can keep it on when you need to.

        "- SARS-CoV-2 infection is transmitted predominantly by inhalation of respiratory droplets generated when people cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe. CDC recommends community use of masks to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Masks are primarily intended to reduce the emission of virus-laden droplets by the wearer (\u201csource control\u201d), which is especially relevant for asymptomatic or presymptomatic infected wearers who feel well and may be unaware of their infectiousness to others (estimated to account for more than 50% of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions). 1, 2 Masks also help reduce inhalation of these droplets by the wearer (\u201cfiltration for wearer protection\u201d). The community benefit of masking for SARS-CoV-2 control is due to the combination of these two effects (source control and filtration for wearer protection); individual prevention benefit increases with increasing numbers of people using masks consistently and correctly.

        "- There are many fabric variables to reckon with for a homemade mask. Consider building a three-layer system. This three-layer system includes a space between the inner and outer layers for a removable middle layer. A replaceable \u201cfilter\u201d is inserted in that space. If one fabric layer is too thin, add additional layers for protection.

        "- Experimental and epidemiologic data support community masking to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2, including alpha and delta variants, among adults and children. The prevention benefit of masking is derived from the combination of source control and wearer protection. The relationship between source control and wearer protection is likely complementary and possibly synergistic, so that individual benefit increases with increasing community mask use. Mask use has been found to be safe and is not associated with clinically significant impacts on respiration or gas exchange under most circumstances, except for intense exercise. The limited available data indicate no clear evidence that masking impairs emotional or language development in children. Further research is needed to assess masks, particularly to identify the combinations of materials that maximize both their blocking and filtering effectiveness, as well as fit, comfort, durability, and consumer appeal.

        "- These findings reinforce that in addition to being up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations, consistently wearing a face mask or respirator in indoor public settings reduces the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using a respirator offers the highest level of personal protection against acquiring infection, although it is most important to wear a mask or respirator that is comfortable and can be used consistently.

        "- The use of face masks or respirators (N95/KN95) is recommended to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 ( 1 ). Well-fitting face masks and respirators effectively filter virus-sized particles in laboratory conditions ( 2 , 3 ), though few studies have assessed their real-world effectiveness in preventing acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection ( 4 ).

A size 40 micron particle is visible with the naked eye \u2013 anything smaller, you need specialized equipment to see it. Protective masks like the N95 are designed to prevent virus particles from flowing in and out of the mask. Due to current shortages , N95 masks should be reserved for COVID-19 health care workers only.

        "- Homemade masks cannot block or filter the SARS-CoV-2 virus, because it can easily flow through every common material people have at home. However, a homemade mask is still better than none at all. If made correctly, a homemade mask can reduce the transmission of the virus from the wearer to others by impeding large droplets and spray produced by a cough or sneeze. It can also reduce the transmission of the virus from others to the wearer.

        "- Multi-layer cloth masks block release of exhaled respiratory particles into the environment, 3-6 along with any microorganisms associated with these particles. 7, 8 Cloth masks not only effectively block most large droplets (i.e., 20-30 microns and larger), 9 but they can also block the exhalation of fine droplets and particles (also often referred to as aerosols) smaller than 10 microns 3, 5 which increase in number with the volume of speech 10-12 and specific types of phonation. 13 Multi-layer cloth masks can both block 50-70% of these fine droplets and particles 3, 14 and limit the forward spread of those that are not captured.

        "- Studies demonstrate that cloth mask materials can also reduce wearers\u2019 exposure to infectious droplets through filtration, including filtration of fine droplets and particles less than 10 microns. The relative filtration effectiveness of various masks has varied widely across studies, in large part due to variation in experimental design and particle sizes analyzed. Multiple layers of cloth with higher thread counts have demonstrated superior performance compared to single layers of cloth with lower thread counts, in some cases filtering nearly 50% of fine particles less than 1 micron.
