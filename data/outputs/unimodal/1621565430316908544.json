    "correction_response": "This tweet is somewhat misleading. While it's true that the U.S. economy added 10,726,000 jobs between President Biden\u2019s inauguration and December, it's not accurate to say this is more than any president in any four-year term. The claim doesn't account for the fact that many of these jobs were recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, not entirely new positions. Furthermore, the number of unfilled job openings soared to nearly 11.9 million during Biden\u2019s first 14 months in office, indicating a high demand for labor that was not entirely met. \nhttps://www.factcheck.org/2023/01/bidens-numbers-january-2023-update/\nhttps://www.factcheck.org/2021/10/trumps-final-numbers/",
