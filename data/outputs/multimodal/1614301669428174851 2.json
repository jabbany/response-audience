        "- The Facebook post\u2019s version of the graph closely resembles one posted by a LinkedIn user six years ago. In both the tweet and the LinkedIn post, the graph is marked \u201cCopyright: Joseph Toomey\u201d and the data is attributed to \u201cR. B. Alley\u201d or Richard B. Alley, a professor of geosciences at Penn State University . Prof Alley described the graph in an email to AAP FactCheck as a \u201czombie that just won\u2019t die\u201d. He pointed to a debunk by Andrew Revkin for the New York Times blog Dot Earth in 2010 and a fact check by Carbon Brief in 2019.

        "- Prof Mix said extrapolating the claim from the graph was problematic given it plots temperatures from \u201cone particular high elevation site atop the Greenland Ice Sheet\u2026.not global temperatures.\u201d He also noted the graph ends in the year 1885, \u201can anomalously cold time. So it appears some particular data were picked for this tweet, and other data were excluded\u201d.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is misleading. The graph used is based on data from a specific high elevation site in Greenland, not global temperatures, making it an inaccurate representation of global warming. Furthermore, the graph ends in 1885, an anomalously cold time, skewing the perception of temperature trends. Recent studies have found that current temperatures are higher than 90% of the entire Holocene. The graph's temperature reconstruction has been described as \"nonsense\" by experts.
