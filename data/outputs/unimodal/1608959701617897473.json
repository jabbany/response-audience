The letter stated that these former intelligence officials, based on their past experience, had serious concerns that the laptop had the potential to be linked to Russian disinformation efforts.

        "- The independent analysis, by two cyber investigators from Minneapolis-based Computer Forensics Services, found no evidence that the user data had been modified, fabricated or tampered with.
