While one app, Tweetbot, briefly came back online over the weekend, that was only because co-creator Paul Haddad swapped out its API keys. This put the app in a semi-working state and allowed it to temporarily bypass the ban.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is potentially misleading. While it's true that Twitter is enforcing its API rules, leading to some apps not working, the tweet fails to mention that Twitter has not provided clear information on which specific rules are being violated by third-party apps like Twitterrific and Tweetbot. Developers of these apps have expressed confusion and frustration, stating they have always complied with Twitter's API rules and are unaware of any recent changes.
