But a distinction \u2014 between what is real and what is fiction \u2014 that is mostly obvious and unproblematic in popular culture isn\u2019t functioning so neatly in the museum setting.

        "- Marshall often uses her family, especially her sons, Raphael and Jacob, in videos that are \u201cboth frighteningly real and blatantly fictitious,\u201d according to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which accessioned the 1998 \u201cWhen I Grow Up I Want to be a Cooker.\u201d That work, now on display at the NMWA, shows one of Marshall\u2019s sons as a toddler, appearing to smoke a cigarette with the relish of an addict.

The art is actually the work of Serbian artist Biljana \u0110ur\u0111evic\u0301, some of which is owned by Podesta's brother, Tony Podesta.
