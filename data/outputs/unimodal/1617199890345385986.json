    "correction_response": "This tweet is somewhat misinformed. While it's true that a survey was sent to Florida universities requesting information about students who sought or received gender-affirming care, it did not specifically ask for the names of these students. The survey seeks data on the number of \"encounters\" where sex reassignment was sought and the names of facilities that patients were referred to. It also asks for a breakdown by age and the number of individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria. However, the memo explicitly states that students' identities should be protected when completing the information. Therefore, the claim that DeSantis is asking for the names of every student who has had gender assignment surgery is incorrect. \n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/desantis-seeks-transgender-university-students-health-care-information-rcna66495\nhttps://www.tampabay.com/news/education/2023/01/18/desantis-budget-office-requires-universities-detail-gender-affirming-care/\nhttps://apnews.com/article/ron-desantis-colleges-and-universities-race-ethnicity-florida-education-97d0b8aef2fc3a60733c8bd4080cc07b",
