As he noted, the standards actually recommend some of the books on the alleged \"banned book list\" in its \" Sample Titles of Complex Texts by Grade Band \" category. Those books are \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and \"The Call of the Wild\" for eighth graders , \"1984\" for ninth graders and \"Of Mice and Men\" and \"Lord of the Flies\" for 10th graders .
