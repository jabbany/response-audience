        "- This Supreme Court is increasingly facing a legitimacy crisis,\" said Rep. Johnson, Chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet. \"Five of the six conservative justices on the bench were appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote, and they are now racing to impose their out-of-touch agenda on the American people, who do not want it. Term limits are a necessary step toward restoring balance to this radical, unrestrained majority on the court.

        "- At the end of 2021, Chief Justice Roberts\u2019 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary stressed the importance of a Court empowered by its institutional independence, insulated from \u201cinappropriate political influence\u201d to ensure a preservation of public trust. Despite this, Americans have their doubts: of the 84 percent who say that justices should keep their political views out of their decisions, only 18 percent feel they do it well.

        "- This will be the first time the notion of Supreme Court term limits has been proposed as a bill, rather than a constitutional amendment, meaning the legislation can pass with simple majorities in the House and Senate, rather than waiting through the long amendment process with the higher two-thirds vote threshold.

        "- Judicial appointments are also increasingly contentious. The recent appointments of Justices Kavanaugh and Brown Jackson were characterized by a type of partisan infighting that had died down since the now long-ago hearings of Bork and Thomas. The days of justices receiving over 90 votes ended with the late Justice Ginsburg\u2019s confirmation in 1993.

        "- Over the last 44 years, Republicans have held the presidency for 24 years and appointed 11 justices. In contrast, Democrats have held the presidency for 20 years and appointed only 4 justices. Khanna's legislation will eliminate the arbitrary nature of Supreme Court vacancies by creating a regular, fair process that doesn't reshape the Court for decades at a time.

        "- With all the harmful and out-of-touch rulings from the Supreme Court this last year, legislation creating 18-year terms for justices is essential,\" said Chairman Jerrold Nadler. \"Otherwise, we will be left with backwards-looking majority for a generation or more. Instead, under this bill, each President would be entitled to appoint two justices. We would begin to see a Court that better represents this nation and that better reflects the public whose rights it is responsible for protecting.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is accurate in expressing a concern about the longevity of Supreme Court justices' terms and the potential for imbalance in the Court's representation. The U.S. is unique among modern constitutional democracies in allowing justices to serve for decades without term or age limits. This has led to some presidents appointing no justices and others appointing a significant portion of the Court. The Supreme Court TERM Act proposes 18-year term limits for justices, which would create a regular appointment process and ensure each president the opportunity to nominate two justices per four-year term. This could make the Court more representative of the nation and restore a constitutional balance to the three branches of the federal government. A majority of Americans are in favor of term limits. However, it's important to note that Khanna's bill would only apply to justices approved after its passage, and current justices would be exempt from the term limits. \nReferences: \nhttp://hankjohnson.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-johnson-introduces-supreme-court-justice-term-limit-measure-restore\nhttp://khanna.house.gov/media/press-releases/release-rep-ro-khanna-proposes-supreme-court-term-limits-appointments-schedule\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/articles/term-limits-a-way-to-tackle-the-supreme-courts-crisis-of-legitimacy/",

        "- America is alone among modern constitutional democracies in allowing its high-court justices to serve for decades without term or age limits, resulting in some Presidents appointing no justices and others appointing as much as a third of the Court. Regularizing appointments every two years will ensure a Supreme Court that is more representative of the nation, reflecting the choices of recently elected Presidents and Senators. Term limits for Supreme Court justices are an essential tool to restoring a constitutional balance to the three branches of the federal government.

        "- Khanna's bill would establish 18-year term limits on any Supreme Court Justices approved after his bill's passage. After their 18-year terms, justices would then be allowed to continue their service on lower courts, as former Justices Souter and O'Connor currently do. Current justices would be exempt from the term limits.

        "- Tenure limits are a more robust alternative. They would ensure a cyclical and predictable turnover, something that Justices Kagan, Breyer, and Roberts have reflected on as positives for the Court. This would allow for new minds to join regularly and ensure one president or party does not have an outsized influence on the Court and trajectory of constitutional review for decades to come \u2014 with each president likely being able to appoint a justice at least once or twice during his or her term in the White House. An increase in turnover would also mean justices are less insulated from everyday life and more in touch with the direction of legal analysis on particularly contentious issues.
