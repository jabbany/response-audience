        "- While economic downturns typically spur employers to turn away from physical labor and toward automation, the social distancing required by Covid-19 was an extra motivator. Combine that with advanced technology \u2014 along with historically low interest rates to make it cheaper to purchase it \u2014 and the move was a no-brainer for many manufacturers.

        "- One area that Biden\u2019s message doesn\u2019t address: The recent manufacturing job gains leave employment well below historical highs. Since peaking in 1979, manufacturing job numbers have fallen by just more than one-third, even as the overall number of available workers in all U.S. sectors has grown by 57% during the same period.

        "- Other factors encouraged the manufacturing jobs recovery and were clearly beyond Biden\u2019s control, such as international trade disruptions caused by the pandemic. 'U.S. manufacturers may have faced less overseas competition than they would have faced without the pandemic, giving them reason to boost employment,' Burtless said.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is partially misinformed. While it's true that the fact-check may seem negative towards Biden, it's important to note that it's providing context to his claim about job creation. Biden's statement about creating 700,000 manufacturing jobs is numerically correct, but it doesn't account for other factors like the pandemic relief bills that began under Trump and contributed to the rise in manufacturing jobs. Also, the recent job gains still leave manufacturing employment well below historical highs. Therefore, the fact-check isn't necessarily smearing negativity, but rather providing a more nuanced view of the situation. \nReferences: \nhttps://www.politifact.com/article/2022/nov/01/joe-biden-and-manufacturing-jobs-closer-look/\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/16/trump-manufacturing-jobs-record-415588",
