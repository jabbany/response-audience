        "- Here's what happens, according to Dennis Harmon, division chief for the Border Patrol Houlton sector in Maine. Border Patrol agents set up immigration checkpoints on highways within 100 miles of a U.S. border. They stop every vehicle traveling on the road, and ask each person if they are a U.S. citizen. If the person replies, 'Yes,' they are a citizen, in most cases, they are free to go.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is misleading. The Supreme Court ruling in question pertains to a specific case where a Border Patrol agent was accused of unlawfully entering a property and using excessive force. The court did not rule that Border Patrol can enter any home without a warrant and assault individuals within 100 miles of the border. Furthermore, Fourth Amendment protections do apply within the 100-mile zone, and individuals have the right to remain silent and not consent to a search. However, Border Patrol agents can set up immigration checkpoints within this zone and ask individuals about their citizenship status. \nReferences: \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/08/supreme-court-border-patrol-smugglers-inn/\nhttps://www.npr.org/2018/09/20/649187775/federal-agents-board-buses-100-miles-from-border-to-ask-are-you-a-u-s-citizen",
