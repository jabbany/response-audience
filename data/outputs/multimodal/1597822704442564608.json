        "- When Byrd died in June 2010, as the longest-serving U.S. senator in history, he left behind a complicated legacy. He joined the KKK in the early 1940s and was still a supporter as late as 1946, although he later said he was only a member for around a year.

        "- At his funeral in July 2010, Byrd was eulogized by former President Bill Clinton, as well as Biden himself and then-President Obama. Obama alluded to Byrd's past involvement in white supremacist activities: 'Of course, Robert Byrd was a deeply religious man, a Christian. And so he understood that our lives are marked by sins as well as virtues, failures as well as successes, weakness as well as strength. We know there are things he said and things he did that he came to regret. I remember talking about that the first time I visited with him. He said 'There are things I regretted in my youth. You may know that.' And I said 'None of us are absent some regrets, Senator. That's why we enjoy and seek the grace of God.' And as I reflect on the full sweep of his 92 years, it seems to me that his life bent towards justice. Like the Constitution he tucked in his pocket, like our nation itself, Robert Byrd possessed that quintessential American quality, and that is a capacity to change, a capacity to learn, a capacity to listen, a capacity to be made more perfect.'

The NAACP\u2019s President and CEO remarked: \"Senator Byrd reflects the transformative power of this nation.

        "- Throughout Byrd\u2019s political career, he continually denounced his involvement with the Klan. \u201cThe greatest mistake I ever made was joining the Ku Klux Klan,\u201d Byrd said in a 1993 interview with CNN\u2019s Bernard Shaw, according to Slate . \u201cAnd I\u2019ve said that many times. But one cannot erase what he has done. He can only change his ways and his thoughts. That was an albatross around my neck that I will always wear.
