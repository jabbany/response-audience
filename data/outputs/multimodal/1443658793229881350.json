        "- A major culprit is the GOP tax cuts, enacted in late 2017. They significantly reduced government revenues. Goldwein estimated the tax cut law could account for about $1 trillion of the debt increase during the Trump years. But the impact of the law extends well beyond that, if Congress doesn\u2019t change it. The CBO estimated the 2017 tax law would add $1.9 trillion to yearly deficits over a 10-year period.

        "- After he took office, Trump predicted that economic growth created by the 2017 tax cut, combined with the proceeds from the tariffs he imposed on a wide range of goods from numerous countries, would help eliminate the budget deficit and let the U.S. begin to pay down its debt. On July 27, 2018, he told Sean Hannity of Fox News: \u201cWe have $21 trillion in debt. When this [the 2017 tax cut] really kicks in, we\u2019ll start paying off that debt like it\u2019s water.\u201d Reference: https://www.propublica.org/article/national-debt-trump published on 2021-01-14 00:00:00",
        "- That\u2019s not how it played out. When Trump took office in January 2017, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office was projecting that federal budget deficits would be 2% to 3% of our gross domestic product during Trump\u2019s term. Instead, the deficit reached nearly 4% of gross domestic product in 2018 and 4.6% in 2019. Reference: https://www.propublica.org/article/national-debt-trump published on 2021-01-14 00:00:00",
        "- The total national debt did go up by $7.8 trillion during Trump\u2019s four years. It rose from nearly $20 trillion the day Trump was inaugurated to nearly $27.8 trillion on the day he left office.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is partially accurate. It's true that Trump's tax cuts, particularly the reduction in the corporate tax rate, significantly increased the national debt by about $1.9 trillion over 11 years, as per the CBO's estimation (https://www.propublica.org/article/national-debt-trump). However, while President Biden claims his Build Back Better Agenda is fully paid for, it's important to note that this is based on the assumption of increased taxes on large corporations and the super wealthy. Whether this plan will indeed reduce the national debt in the long run remains to be seen (https://www.factcheck.org/2021/08/biden-leaves-misleading-impression-on-u-s-debt/).",

        "- The combination of Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cut and the lack of any serious spending restraint helped both the deficit and the debt soar. So when the once-in-a-lifetime viral disaster slammed our country and we threw more than $3 trillion into COVID-19-related stimulus, there was no longer any margin for error.
