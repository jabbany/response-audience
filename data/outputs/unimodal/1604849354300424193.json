        "- Inflation in the United States was relatively low for so long that, for entire generations of Americans, rapid price hikes may have seemed like a relic of the distant past. Between the start of 1991 and the end of 2019, year-over-year inflation averaged about 2.3% a month, and exceeded 5.0% only four times. Today, Americans rate inflation as the nation\u2019s top problem , and President Joe Biden has said addressing the problem is his top domestic priority .

        "- Inflation doesn\u2019t appear to be done with the developed world just yet. An interim report from the OECD found that April\u2019s inflation rate ran ahead of March\u2019s figure in 32 of the group\u2019s 38 member countries.

        "- In the short term, the Federal Reserve (the Fed) plans to increase interest rates several times in 2022, which should slow inflation. The Fed kept interest rates at extremely low rates throughout the pandemic in an effort to stimulate economic growth and counteract the effects of Covid-19 on the U.S. economy. The Fed is now considering more aggressive courses of action to protect U.S. producers and consumers from sustained price hikes.

        "- In response to a historically high inflation rate and a strong labor market, the Fed began raising interest rates in early 2022. At its June 2022 meeting, the Fed raised its target for the federal funds rate by 0.75 percentage points to a target range of 1.5 to 1.75 percent, its largest single-meeting rate hike since 1994.

        "- It will likely take longer for higher prices to return to pre-inflation levels. Predictions vary, but most economists expect inflation to ease in the coming months. Month-to-month price increases have already slowed, indicating that inflation may be reaching a peak. Some have predicted that once the nation gets beyond the current Covid-19 surge, prices will stabilize and begin to drop within three to six months.

        "- When inflation fell below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent objective in the 2010s, some Fed officials worried that inflation expectations might move below its long-run target; when inflation soared in 2021 and 2022, some Fed officials worried that inflation expectations might move above that long-run target.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is misleading. While it's true that month-to-month price increases have slowed, indicating that inflation may be reaching a peak, the overall inflation rate remains high. Food prices, for example, increased by 6.3% from December 2020 to December 2021, with grocery prices up in almost every category. This has been the highest price increase for consumer goods since 1982, causing concern among economists, policymakers, and the public. Therefore, it's not accurate to suggest that inflation has slowed to the point of providing relief for families at the grocery store. \nhttps://www.csis.org/analysis/high-prices-empty-shelves\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/06/15/in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world-inflation-is-high-and-getting-higher/",
