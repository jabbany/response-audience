        "- They extracted the spike protein from Omicron and attached it with the strain first detected at the onset of the pandemic that began in Wuhan, China.

        "- But several virologists argued on Twitter that the study is not as alarming as it first appears. For one thing, the hybrid virus was less lethal than the early variant modified in the study. They also noted that other researchers have published the results of similar experiments that did not draw similar concerns. And it\u2019s not clear the study is very different from other chimeric virus studies that NIAID has exempted from review.

        "- Through more testing, the researchers at Boston University learned that the \u201cS\u201d protein is not the primary determinant and only partly responsible for Omicron\u2019s cause of infection. Still, researchers say further studies are needed to identify mutations outside of the \u201cS\u201d protein and see how they act.

        "- It was also tested in mice that are \u201cexquisitely sensitive\u201d to SARS-CoV-2 because they have been engineered so their lung cells are packed with the receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to break into human cells, Neil noted. The scientists forced a huge amount of virus up the noses of the mice, far more than a person would typically encounter. As a result, the mouse mortality rate of 80% was far higher than the human mortality from the original SARS-CoV-2 variant, which is about 1% or less.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is somewhat misleading. While it's true that Boston University researchers developed a hybrid COVID strain in a lab that killed 80% of infected mice, the tweet could be interpreted as suggesting this strain is lethal to humans at the same rate, which is not the case. The mice used in the study were engineered to be highly sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 and were exposed to a much higher viral load than a human would typically encounter. The research was conducted to understand the role of a specific protein associated with the Omicron variant, not to create a more lethal strain. The research was also approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee and the Boston Public Health Commission. \nhttps://www.science.org/content/article/was-study-created-hybrid-covid-19-virus-too-risky\nhttps://www.newsnationnow.com/health/coronavirus/boston-university-researchers-create-new-covid-strain/",
