        "- Opting to go maskless will certainly have repercussions, and at this point, the resulting delays or cancellations may be more than the airline industry can handle. Over the past weekend, over 12,000 flights in the U.S. were delayed or cancelled due to a variety of factors, including poor weather, technology issues, and \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 staffing shortages.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is accurate. After dropping mask requirements, airlines like EasyJet have experienced staff shortages due to increased COVID-19 cases. This has led to a significant increase in flight cancellations compared to pre-pandemic levels. The staff shortages are not solely due to COVID-19, but also due to a tight labor market and delays in security checks for new and returning staff. The situation serves as a crucial consideration for the U.S. as it contemplates lifting federal airline mask mandates. \nReferences: \nhttps://jalopnik.com/overseas-airlines-dropped-mask-mandates-now-theyre-bat-1848762415 \nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/europe/hit-by-staff-shortages-airlines-airports-struggle-with-travel-recovery-2022-04-05/",

        "- Masks have not been required on flights operated by budget-friendly, Swiss airline EasyJet since March 27, the airline said in a statement. The move came after the UK removed all travel restrictions earlier in March. [...] Between March 28 and April 3, EasyJet cancelled 202 of its 3,517 flights scheduled to depart from the UK, according to data provided to CBS MoneyWatch from Cirium, an aviation analytics company. By comparison, the carrier cancelled zero flights departing from the UK during the same period in 2019, before the pandemic. An EasyJet spokesperson attributed the increase in cancelled flights to \u201chigher than usual staff sickness levels\u201d due to a recent surge in COVID-19 cases across Europe.
