    "correction_response": "This tweet is partially correct. Tesla does indeed sell emissions credits, which have significantly contributed to its profitability. In 2020, regulatory credits accounted for $1.18 billion, or 7% of total automotive revenue, and without this revenue, Tesla would not have achieved a profitable quarter (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-results/tesla-sets-revenue-record-makes-profit-thanks-to-pollution-credit-sales-to-rivals-idUSKBN27631E). However, it's misleading to say that Tesla is not a car company. Tesla has consistently increased its vehicle deliveries and set a target to deliver half a million vehicles by the end of 2020 (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-results/tesla-sets-revenue-record-makes-profit-thanks-to-pollution-credit-sales-to-rivals-idUSKBN27631E). Therefore, while emissions credits are a significant part of Tesla's business model, it is still fundamentally a car manufacturer.",
