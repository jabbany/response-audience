        "- Today\u2019s jobs report shows that the economy added 223,000 jobs last month\u2014capping the two strongest years of job growth in history. This is just the latest sign President Biden\u2019s economic plan is working as we continue to transition to more steady, stable growth without giving up all the historic gains achieved for American workers.

        "- Job Openings \u2014 The number of unfilled job openings soared to a record of nearly 11.9 million during Biden\u2019s first 14 months in office, but then declined after the Federal Reserve began a steep series of interest-rate increases aimed at cooling the economy to bring down price inflation.

        "- Labor Force Participation \u2014 One reason many job openings go unfilled is that millions of Americans left the workforce during the pandemic and haven\u2019t returned. The labor force participation rate (the percentage of the total population over age 16 that is either employed or actively seeking work) has inched up slightly during Biden\u2019s time, from 61.3% in January 2021 to 62.3% in December.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is accurate. The U.S. economy did add 10,726,000 jobs between Biden\u2019s inauguration and December, making 2021 and 2022 the two strongest years of job growth in history. The unemployment rate also fell from 6.3% to 3.5% during this period. However, it's worth noting that the labor force participation rate only increased slightly, from 61.3% to 62.3%, indicating that many job openings went unfilled due to people leaving the workforce during the pandemic. \nhttps://www.factcheck.org/2023/01/bidens-numbers-january-2023-update/\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/06/icymi-two-years-of-record-job-creation-and-other-signs-of-progress-from-december-jobs-report/",
