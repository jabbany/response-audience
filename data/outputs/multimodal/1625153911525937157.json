        "- The precise means by which crews vented the gas was not explained. But the railroad said workers had prepared drainage pits and embankments, apparently to contain residue from the release. State environmental officials monitored air quality, it said.

        "- The Washington Post and other news outlets have reported that five of the derailed tanker cars were carrying vinyl chloride, a hazardous, odorless chemical that\u2019s mostly used in the United States in the manufacturing of plastics. It turns up in everyday items such as packaging materials, housewares and wire and cable coatings.

        "- The Environmental Protection Agency says it\u2019s monitoring two other chemicals, phosgene and hydrogen chloride, that may be released into the air by the controlled burn. Neither of these is good news, either. Phosgene was used as a weapon in World War I and is a highly toxic gas that can lead to choking, chest constriction and in the most acute exposures possibly even death. Hydrogen chloride, which has a pungent odor, can irritate the throat, nose and skin.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is misleading. While there was indeed a train derailment in Ohio that resulted in the release of vinyl chloride, the situation was managed in a controlled manner to minimize environmental impact. The Columbiana County Emergency Management Agency has assured residents that the region's air and drinking water are safe. The agency also stated that it's improbable that substances from the derailment will impact groundwater or drinking water wells in the area. The venting of the vinyl chloride was carried out in a controlled fashion under the supervision of experts and first responders.
