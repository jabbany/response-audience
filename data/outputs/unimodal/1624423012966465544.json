    "correction_response": "This tweet is misleading. While it's true that the deficit is projected to shrink to $1.0 trillion in 2022 from $2.8 trillion the previous year, it's important to note that the policies enacted under President Biden's administration have added nearly $10 trillion in new spending. This has resulted in a projected cumulative deficit over the 2022\u20132031 period that is $2.4 trillion more than previous estimates. Furthermore, the average deficit for the next decade under President Biden\u2019s FY23 budget is projected to be $1.6 trillion, which is $600 billion higher than the last decade. \nReferences: \nhttps://budget.house.gov/press-release/fact-check-biden-brags-about-deficit-reduction-while-adding-nearly-10-trillion-in-new-spending/\nhttps://www.cbo.gov/publication/58147",
