        "- Lower Health Care Costs. The Build Back Better Agenda would reduce health insurance premiums, saving 9 million people an average of $50 per person per month, and add dental, vision, and hearing coverage to Medicare. By closing the Medicaid gap for low-income Americans, the President\u2019s plan would help 4 million uninsured people gain coverage. President Biden\u2019s agenda would also expand home care for older and disabled Americans, while improving the jobs and the pay of the home care workers who care for them.

Americans pay 2-3 times more for their prescription drugs than people in other wealthy countries, and nearly 1 in 4 Americans struggle to afford prescription drugs. President Biden\u2019s plan will lower prescription drug costs for Americans by letting Medicare negotiate drug prices, so consumers are no longer at the whim of pharmaceutical companies.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is partially accurate. The Build Back Better Agenda does aim to raise taxes on the wealthiest and large corporations to fund its initiatives, protecting 97% of small businesses from income tax increases and delivering tax cuts to millions of entrepreneurs (https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/19/fact-sheet-the-build-back-better-agenda-will-provide-greater-tax-fairness-for-small-businesses/). However, the claim that the agenda costs $0 is misleading. The proposal is estimated to raise around $2.9 trillion, which would partially cover the $3.5 trillion legislation, with the rest expected to be made up from long-term economic growth (https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/democrats-seek-corporate-wealthy-tax-hikes-for-3-5-trillion-plan). Furthermore, the final cost of the bill is still under negotiation, with some suggesting it may need to be reduced to $1-1.5 trillion to gain necessary support (https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/democrats-seek-corporate-wealthy-tax-hikes-for-3-5-trillion-plan).",

        "- President Biden\u2019s Build Back Better Agenda will make the tax code fairer while protecting millions of small businesses from tax increases. For example, President Biden\u2019s proposal to restore the corporate tax rate halfway back to its pre-2018 level would not affect any small businesses that file taxes as a passthrough entity (LLCs, S-corps, and sole proprietorships). That\u2019s nearly every small business in America. Similarly, the President\u2019s proposal to restore the top income tax bracket to its pre-2018 level \u2013 which would only raise taxes by 2.6 percentage points for the wealthiest households in America \u2013 would affect less than 3 percent of small business owners, according to the Treasury Department\u2019s new analysis focused exclusively on small businesses filing as S-corporations, partnerships, and on individual income tax return Form 1040 Schedules C, E and F (as noted, nearly every small business falls in this category).

        "- Tax Cuts for Families with Children. One third of all adults with children struggle to pay their usual expenses. The American Rescue Plan increased the Child Tax Credit from $2,000 per child to $3,000 per child for children over six and $3,600 for children under six. The Build Back Better Agenda will extend the Child Tax Credit expansion in the American Rescue Plan, providing 39 million households and nearly 90 percent of American children a major tax cut and cutting child poverty nearly in half.

        "- The proposed top tax rate would revert to 39.6% on couples earning more than $450,000, and there would be a 3% tax on wealthier Americans making beyond $5 million a year.
