        "- Last month, Rep. Pressley, Sen.

        "- Despite broad support for student loan relief, Americans have a range of qualms about President Biden\u2019s plan. They are evenly divided on the threshold question of whether the president has the legal authority to cancel student loan debt, an issue that is certain to be contested in court.

        "- There\u2019s another good reason to cancel student debt: For many borrowers, it\u2019s never going to be paid back. In fact, current policy encourages nonrepayment while at the same time failing to confront its implications. This is why student debt cancellation isn\u2019t comparable to other policies for redistributing wealth or income\u2014its impact, distributional or otherwise, can\u2019t be evaluated de novo, because it\u2019s already happening.

        "- Most analysts believe there is a student debt problem in the United States, and even conservative scholars acknowledge some debt must be forgiven. Tuition is outpacing students\u2019 ability to pay, and the share of students taking out loans to finance their degrees rose from roughly half (49%) to over two-thirds (69%) from 1993 to 2012, according to the Pew Research Center .

        "- \"The student debt crisis is a racial and economic justice issue,\u201d said Congresswoman Pressley . \u201cWith this pandemic worsening daily, we need bold and high impact policies that will match the scale and scope of the crisis and truly offer immediate relief for people\u2014this must include across the board student debt cancellation.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is accurate. President Biden does have the legal authority to cancel student loan debt, as outlined in Section 432(a) of the Higher Education Act. This authority has been used before to cancel the debt of students defrauded by for-profit colleges and to cancel the interest on federal student loans. However, it's worth noting that there is a divide in opinion on whether the president should use this authority, with some Republicans arguing that he has exceeded his legal authority. \nReferences: \nhttps://pressley.house.gov/2021/07/29/pressley-reaffirms-president-s-authority-and-urgency-cancel-student-debt/\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/articles/do-americans-support-president-bidens-student-loan-plan/",
