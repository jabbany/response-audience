But in the accompanying letter, the lawyers, Debra Katz and Lisa Banks, said they would not produce copies of Ford's 'medical records.'

I have described the events publicly before. I summarized them in my letter to Ranking Member Feinstein, and again in my letter to Chairman Grassley.

        "- As a former prosecutor, I believe Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez. Victims of sexual assault are among the least likely crime victims to come forward because of the social and emotional costs of reporting. The despicable way the college professor has been threatened and attacked demonstrates exactly why more victims don't report sexual crimes. Ramirez, like Ford, came forward with allegations against Kavanaugh despite knowing her personal life would be upended. Their bravery is commendable and, at minimum, we in Congress owe them an investigation.

While it's true that Christine Blasey Ford passed a polygraph test and provided therapist notes about the alleged assault (https://abc7news.com/christine-blasey-ford-polygraph-kavanaugh-test-confirmation/4345735/), it's important to note that the individuals Ford identified as being present during the alleged incident, including Kavanaugh's high school friends Patrick J. Smyth and Mark Judge, have stated they have no recollection of the event (https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-court-kavanaugh-witnesses-factbox/witnesses-in-the-kavanaugh-fbi-probe-idUKKCN1ME2QV). Kavanaugh himself has categorically denied the allegations (https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/kavanaugh-accuser-ford-provides-four-sworn-declarations-supporting-her-allegation-n913216).
