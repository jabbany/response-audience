        "- The Scranton-born Biden is leaning hard into his Pennsylvania roots. Trump won the state in an upset by just 44,292 votes in 2016 and has hoped to win favor with the state\u2019s beleaguered steel industry by slapping tariffs on imports. Biden argues to Democrats that he provides their strongest shot here and in two other crucial industrial states \u2014 Wisconsin and Michigan.

        "- Sluggish and uneven wage growth has been cited as a key factor behind widening income inequality in the United States. A recent Pew Research Center report , based on an analysis of household income data from the Census Bureau, found that in 2016 Americans in the top tenth of the income distribution earned 8.7 times as much as Americans in the bottom tenth ($109,578 versus $12,523). In 1970, when the analysis period began, the top tenth earned 6.9 times as much as the bottom tenth ($63,512 versus $9,212).

        "- Meanwhile, wage gains have gone largely to the highest earners. Since 2000, usual weekly wages have risen 3% (in real terms) among workers in the lowest tenth of the earnings distribution and 4.3% among the lowest quarter. But among people in the top tenth of the distribution, real wages have risen a cumulative 15.7%, to $2,112 a week \u2013 nearly five times the usual weekly earnings of the bottom tenth ($426).

        "- Beginning in the 1970s, economic growth slowed and the income gap widened. Income growth for households in the middle and lower parts of the distribution slowed sharply, while incomes at the top continued to grow strongly.

        "- The years from the end of World War II into the 1970s were ones of substantial economic growth and broadly shared prosperity. Incomes grew rapidly and at roughly the same rate up and down the income ladder, roughly doubling in inflation-adjusted terms between the late 1940s and early 1970s.

        "- While the post-Great Recession expansion was long, both the economy\u2019s average annual growth rate and the typical worker\u2019s earnings gains were relatively modest by the standards of earlier long expansions. Former President Trump claimed that his policies would produce a substantial and sustained increase in economic growth, and his Council of Economic Advisers claimed that those policies would boost wages and employment substantially. By contrast, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and many other non-partisan analysts projected much slower economic growth and smaller increases in most workers\u2019 earnings.

        "- The potential for a split between labor leaders and union members is part of the reason why many unions are being very cautious about endorsing any candidate this far before the 2020 election: Many rushed to endorse Hillary Clinton in 2016, in some cases despite splits among their members.

        "- Average hourly earnings of employees on private payrolls grew modestly through much of the recovery from the 2007-09 recession, and through February 2020, wage growth averaged 2.4 percent annually. Inflation was modest as well, but over much of the expansion, real (inflation-adjusted) wages failed to keep up with increases in workers' productivity, as we discuss below in Part III.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is potentially misleading. While it's true that the economy is growing and Americans are working, the claim that incomes are rising faster than inflation is not entirely accurate. Real wages, when adjusted for inflation, have barely changed over the past few decades. In fact, wage growth has mostly benefited the highest-paid workers, not the middle class. Furthermore, the income gap has been widening since the 1970s, with the top 1% of households seeing a much larger increase in their income compared to the middle 60% and the bottom fifth. These facts suggest that the middle class and unions may not be as strong as the tweet implies. \n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/\nhttps://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/a-guide-to-statistics-on-historical-trends-in-income-inequality\nhttps://www.cbpp.org/research/economy/tracking-the-post-great-recession-economy",
