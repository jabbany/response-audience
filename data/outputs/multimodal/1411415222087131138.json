        "- Yes, rules are rules. But no one who watched Richardson win at Trials could possibly think that marijuana fueled her victory. Richardson has acknowledged her mistake, apologized, and will pay the harsh consequences. But sometimes, it would be nice for common sense to rule instead.

        "- The presence of marijuana on the World Anti-Doping Agency\u2019s banned substance list has long been controversial. Canadian snowboarder Ross Rebagliati was originally stripped of his 1998 Olympic gold medal after testing positive for THC, but that decision was overturned since it wasn\u2019t on the banned substance list at the time. USADA singles out three reasons why cannabinoids are banned: athletes could endanger themselves and others because of slower reaction times and poor executive function and decision making, marijuana can be \u201cperformance enhancing for some athletes and sports disciplines,\u201d and the use of \u201cillicit drugs that are harmful to health\u201d is \u201cnot consistent with the athlete as a role model for young people around the world\u201d.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is accurate but lacks context. Sha'Carri Richardson was indeed suspended for one month for marijuana use, which will prevent her from participating in the 100m race at the Tokyo Olympics. However, it's worth noting that her suspension was reduced to one month because her use of cannabis was out of competition and unrelated to sport performance. She also completed a counselling program regarding her use of the drug. The presence of marijuana on the World Anti-Doping Agency\u2019s banned substance list has been controversial, and Richardson's case has sparked further debate. \nhttps://time.com/6077823/shacarri-richardson-drug-test-marijuana-olympics/\nhttps://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/sprinter-richardson-suspended-one-month-after-testing-positive-cannabis-2021-07-02/",

        "- Richardson\u2019s suspension is the rare Olympic drug scandal where everyone loses. The Games will be without a charismatic star in a signature event; her potential showdown with Jamaica\u2019s Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce\u2014who won the 100-m at both the Beijing and Rio Games and in early June clocked the second fastest women\u2019s 100-m in history, 10.63 seconds\u2014created a compelling storyline. The Olympics lose out. Track and field, a sport seemingly forever tainted by drug scandals\u2014of the raw performance-enhancing kind, or not\u2014loses out. Fans lose out. Even her opponents lose out. Sure, the path to a medal becomes easier without Richardson in the field. But any win will forever be accompanied by a sort of hidden asterisk: what, history will wonder, would have happened if Richardson had raced?

        "- In a development that shocked and saddened fans of track and field, and the Olympics, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) announced Friday morning that Richardson had accepted a one-month suspension after testing positive for cannabis, a substance that remains\u2014even in the face of widespread legalization and mainstream acceptance\u2014banned by the World Anti-Doping Code as a \u201csubstance of abuse.\u201d The positive test disqualified her Olympic Trials win, so she will not be able to run in the individual Olympic 100-m race in Tokyo.
