        "- Evidence demonstrates that the approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccines are both efficacious and effective against symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, including severe forms of the disease. In addition, as shown below, a growing body of evidence suggests that COVID-19 vaccines also reduce asymptomatic infection and transmission.

        "- Vaccines can no longer be considered a social norm in the face of a \u201ccitizen science movement\u201d or \u201cmedical populism\u201d propelled by the digital revolution, Larson writes. Vaccines may seem \u201cas normal as brushing teeth,\u201d but not when all aspects are now widely debated and questioned on social media, with the result that doubt outraces faith in vaccines and science.

        "- The case of British researcher Andrew Wakefield, the archetypal leader of the antivaccine movement, is a stark reminder that these problems are not readily \u201ccorrectable.\u201d Wakefield published his famous\u2014and later discredited\u2014research in the Lancet in 1998, alleging that the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine causes autism. Vaccine coverage rates in the UK plummeted, only recovering fifteen years later. Reference: https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.01850 published on 2020-11-10 00:00:00",

They also reduce the risk of infection and transmission. While no vaccine is 100% effective, the benefits of vaccination extend beyond personal health to community protection.

        "- The risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fully vaccinated people cannot be completely eliminated as long as there is continued community transmission of the virus. Early data suggest infections in fully vaccinated persons are more commonly observed with the Delta variant than with other SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, data show fully vaccinated persons are less likely than unvaccinated persons to acquire SARS-CoV-2, and infections with the Delta variant in fully vaccinated persons are associated with less severe clinical outcomes.
