    "correction_response": "This tweet is misleading. While it's true that Trump's passports were taken by the FBI, it was part of a broader search related to documents brought to his Florida estate after his presidency ended. The FBI follows court-ordered procedures and returns items not needed for law enforcement purposes.

Therefore, the seizure of his passports does not necessarily mean he is unable to leave the country. \nReferences: \nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/madelinehalpert/2022/08/15/trump-claims-fbi-took-his-passports-in-mar-a-lago-raid/\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/16/justice-department-trump-passports-search-justification/10336244002/",
