        "- The legislations mostly ban the discussion, training, and/or orientation that the U.S. is inherently racist as well as any discussions about conscious and unconscious bias, privilege, discrimination, and oppression. These parameters also extend beyond race to include gender lectures and discussions.

        "- The Republican-run legislature has been undeterred by nationwide controversy over Florida\u2019s gun laws. The House defeated an effort to repeal the state\u2019s \u201cstand your ground\u201d self-defense law in committee prior to the session, and last week sent the governor a bill that would allow citizens to brandish weapons or fire \u201cwarning shots\u201d to fend off an attack.

        "- In the 114 th Congress, Representative Peter King and Senator Dianne Feinstein introduced the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2015 ( H.R. 1076 and S. 551 ). These proposals would give the Attorney General discretionary authority to deny firearms or explosives transfers to persons watchlisted as known or suspected terrorists if she deemed them to be \"dangerous terrorists.\" These bills mirror a legislative proposal developed by DOJ and submitted to Congress in April 2007. First introduced in the 110 th Congress, these bills have been dubbed the \"Terror Gap\" proposal. Reference: https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/IN10509.html published on 2016-06-16 00:00:00",
        "- Pursuant to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act ( P.L. 103-159 ), in November 1998 the FBI activated NICS for the purposes of determining an individual's firearms transfer and possession eligibility whenever an unlicensed individual seeks to acquire a firearm from a federally licensed gun dealer. Federal law enumerates several grounds that disqualify someone from firearms eligibility. However, being a known or suspected terrorist is not a federal firearms eligibility disqualifier.

        "- The approach of some Republican-led state legislatures is a method for continuing to roll back racial progress regarding everything from voting rights to police reform. This is a horrible idea and does an injustice to our kids. Laws forbidding any teacher or lesson from mentioning race/racism, and even gender/sexism, would put a chilling effect on what educators are willing to discuss in the classroom and provide cover for those who are not comfortable hearing or telling the truth about the history and state of race relations in the United States.

In Florida, carrying a firearm without a license is only permitted in specific situations such as during a natural disaster evacuation, and not as a general rule.

        "- The alleged assailant, 29-year-old Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, acquired these firearms from a federally licensed gun dealer about two weeks prior to the shooting. In so doing, he underwent and passed a background check through a computer system administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), known as the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). In addition, the alleged assailant was employed as a state-licensed security guard and held a concealed carry weapons (CCW) permit . It has been reported that the state-issued security guard license might have allowed the alleged assailant to purchase these firearms with minimal background check requirements. Neither the Florida-issued security guard license nor his CCW permit would have exempted him from the federally required NICS background check, however.
