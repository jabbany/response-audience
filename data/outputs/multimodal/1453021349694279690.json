        "- Rittenhouse, 18, of Antioch, Illinois, was among a number of people who responded to calls on social media to take up arms and come to Kenosha to respond to the protests.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is somewhat misleading. While it's true that the judge ruled against using the term \"victims\" to avoid implying a crime was committed, the defense can only refer to the individuals as \"rioters,\" \"looters,\" or \"arsonists\" if they provide evidence supporting these terms. The same applies to the prosecution, who can use harsh terms to describe Rittenhouse, given they back it up with evidence. \nhttps://www.insider.com/kyle-rittenhouse-judge-allows-defense-to-use-terms-rioters-looters-2021-10\nhttps://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/hearing-may-settle-use-of-force-experts-at-rittenhouse-trial/2653952/",
