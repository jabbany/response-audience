        "- The number of deaths is a function of the population risk of being diagnosed and dying from that cause and the size and age structure of the population. The risk of death from heart disease and cancer generally increases with age, and over the past several decades the US population increased, particularly in the age group 65 years or older (5).

        "- The projections in this study assume that cancer incidence patterns will continue largely unchanged for the next few decades with the 4 leading cancers (female breast, prostate, colon and rectum, and lung and bronchus) accounting for just under 50% of all cancer cases.

        "- The objective of this study was to use mortality data, current population estimates, and population projections to predict age-standardized death rates and death counts for heart disease and cancer from 1969, around the peak of heart disease death rates (risk), through 2020 and to apportion changes in deaths resulting from population risk reduction, population growth, and population aging (ie, shift in age distribution toward older ages and increased longevity).

        "- Our projections make it clear that, to mitigate the impact of a growing and aging population, a substantial, robust, and coordinated focus on primary prevention is needed. If these efforts are to have any significant impact on the number of future cancer cases, they must be implemented immediately, owing to the long latency period for many cancers.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is misleading. While it's true that cancer causes a significant number of deaths in the US, the comparison to the COVID-19 pandemic is not accurate. Cancer is not a contagious disease that can spread from person to person like a virus. Therefore, shutting down schools or businesses would not prevent its spread. Furthermore, the number of cancer cases and deaths are projected to increase due to population growth and aging, not because of a sudden outbreak. Efforts are needed for primary prevention to mitigate the impact of a growing and aging population. \nReferences: \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2016/16_0211.htm \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2021/21_0006.htm",
