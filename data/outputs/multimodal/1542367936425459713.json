    "correction_response": "This tweet is somewhat misleading. While it's true that the Supreme Court, with Justice Clarence Thomas authoring the ruling, recently struck down New York's limits on carrying concealed handguns, it's not accurate to directly attribute this tragic incident to that ruling. The police believe the woman was targeted, but the motive remains unclear. The ruling does make it easier to carry guns in populated cities, but it's important to note that illegal guns are also a significant problem, as stated by NYC Mayor Eric Adams. \n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-supreme-court-strikes-down-new-york-limits-concealed-handguns-2022-06-23/\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/mother-pushing-stroller-shot-and-killed-upper-east-side/\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/06/30/nyc-woman-shot-pushing-baby-stroller/7775735001/",
