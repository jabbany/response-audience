        "- Patients who require covid-19 related hospital admission are a large population with distinct clinical and public health considerations. They have a greater comorbidity burden, more severe initial disease, and worse short term outcomes compared with patients with an asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic clinical course, and they may be more vulnerable to late complications of infection. 4 Better understanding of the post-discharge risk of adverse health outcomes (eg, death) may help tailor preventive strategies, while knowledge of post-discharge healthcare utilization such as readmission may facilitate resource allocation in the context of intermittent surges of covid-19 or during future pandemics. 5 6 Moreover, given advances in therapeutics, growing population level immunity, and changes in the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, such as transmissibility and virulence, understanding how outcomes changed over the course of the pandemic is critical to informing the ongoing management of individuals recovering from covid-19 and future public health interventions.

        "- It is true, however, that the government will pay more to hospitals for COVID-19 cases in two senses: By paying an additional 20% on top of traditional Medicare rates for COVID-19 patients during the public health emergency, and by reimbursing hospitals for treating the uninsured patients with the disease (at that enhanced Medicare rate).

        "- The pandemic is raging, with record high infection and death rates. A new strain of the virus that is even more contagious is appearing in communities across the country. Meanwhile, Americans are waiting to get their vaccines, even while doses are sitting on shelves. More than ten months into the pandemic, we still lack necessary testing capacity and are suffering from shortages of supplies like basic protective equipment for those on the front lines. Americans of color are being infected and are dying from COVID-19 at greater rates because of lasting systemic racism in our health care system. And, older Americans continue to suffer at disproportionate rates.

        "- While COVID-19 has devastated the entire country, it has hit some groups and communities of color much harder than others. President Biden is committed to addressing the disparities evident in the pandemic at every step, from ensuring equitable distribution of vaccines and supplies to expanding health care services for underserved communities. His proposal includes funding to provide health services for underserved populations, including expanding Community Health Centers and investing in health services on tribal lands. These funds will support the expansion of COVID treatment and care, as well as our ability to provide vaccination to underserved populations.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is somewhat misleading. While it's true that a significant portion of COVID-19 deaths occurred among Medicare beneficiaries, this is largely because Medicare primarily serves older adults and individuals with high comorbidity burdens, who are at greater risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19. It's not a reflection on the quality or effectiveness of Medicare itself. The tweet could be interpreted as suggesting that Medicare is somehow responsible for these deaths, which is not supported by the data. \n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.bmj.com/content/382/bmj-2023-076222\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-race/black-americans-hospitalized-for-covid-19-at-four-times-the-rate-of-whites-medicare-data-shows-idUSKBN23T34D\nhttps://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/hospital-payments-and-the-covid-19-death-count/",
