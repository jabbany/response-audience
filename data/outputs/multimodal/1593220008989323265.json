    "correction_response": "This tweet is somewhat misleading. While it's true that Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, has sold shares, it's not necessarily indicative of a lack of confidence in the company. Armstrong has previously stated that he remains bullish on crypto and Coinbase, and is fully dedicated to growing its business. He also plans to sell only 2% of his Coinbase holdings over the next year, while still controlling 59.5% of its voting shares. Furthermore, Armstrong has expressed his expectation for the company\u2019s NFT business to be on par with, or even bigger than its cryptocurrency business. Therefore, his selling of shares could be part of a broader strategy rather than a sign of impending doom. \n\nhttps://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/10/29278664/heres-why-coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-wants-to-sell-2-of-his-company-stake\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/coinbase-chief-executive-armstrong-sold-2918-million-shares-opening-day-2021-04-19/",
