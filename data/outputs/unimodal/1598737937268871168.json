        "- The United States has issued broad-based windfall profits taxes before \u2013 specifically during WWI, WWII, during the Korean War and in the 1980s. These windfall profit taxes were implemented to prevent corporations from profiting from war, disruption, and upheaval. Given the conditions we face in America and around the world, we need to follow that precedent. If this tax had taken effect in 2021 more than $300 billion would have been raised from the 25 largest corporate profiteers.
