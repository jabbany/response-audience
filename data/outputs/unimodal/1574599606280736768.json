It\u2019s very safe to assume that the toilet story, while tantalizing (well, not tantalizing exactly) is probably a nonstarter. After all, while one might assume that Trump was disposing of material that should have been retained during his presidency, we don\u2019t know that for sure. We don\u2019t know Trump placed the paper in the toilet or that it was anything subject to retention rules. And the nature of the incident means we\u2019ll never know.

Trump repeatedly harangued Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign for her use of a private email server while she served in the Obama administration. He often misrepresented and exaggerated her actions, but some material on the server was determined to have been classified. The Justice Department determined that there was \u201cno persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information,\u201d and Clinton \u2014 to Trump\u2019s oft-performed chagrin \u2014 faced no criminal charges.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is potentially misleading. Misprision requires both concealment of a felony and failure to notify federal authorities. Haberman's reporting of Trump's actions doesn't necessarily constitute concealment, and it's unclear if she had a legal obligation to report these actions to authorities. Furthermore, it's not confirmed that the papers Trump allegedly flushed were subject to retention rules or constituted a felony. Lastly, the misprision statute could be seen as encouraging arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, which could be unconstitutional. \nReferences: \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/09/29/misprision-of-felony/\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/10/breaking-law-via-toilet-would-certainly-complete-one-trump-era-story-arc/",
