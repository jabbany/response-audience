    "correction_response": "This tweet is potentially misleading. While it's true that a lawyer has expressed intent to investigate Elon Musk's citizenship application, it's important to note that this does not equate to a formal investigation by any legal authority. Furthermore, Musk has been a U.S. citizen since 2002 and there's little evidence to suggest he was ever in the U.S. without documentation. His immigration process appears to have been legal and through various visa programs. The lawyer's FOIA request for Musk's immigration application also requires Musk's consent before any documents can be obtained. \nhttps://www.foxbusiness.com/media/frequent-msnbc-guest-ripped-plotting-strip-elon-musk-us-citizenship-stupid-incompetent\nhttps://www.snopes.com/fact-check/elon-musk-illegal-immigrant/",
