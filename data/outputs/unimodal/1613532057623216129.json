Across most of the globe, there\u2019s nothing controversial or even questionable about supporting women\u2019s rights.

Statements of sympathy and understanding for demonstrators and their cause have once again highlighted the divergent approaches taken by Europe and the United States when it comes to dealing with Iran.

        "- The Tor project is a project designed to give people a safe way to use the Internet anonymously and securely. But Iran is the first country to block that software. We know how powerful Iran's Islamic regime is, and we know it's hard fighting against them. But we have hope. And we are lucky because we are fighting on the side of the people of Iran. There are other anonymity tools, which the government has not yet blocked.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is potentially misleading. While it suggests that the unrest in Iran was orchestrated by external forces, it's important to note that there are multiple factors contributing to the situation. For instance, the Iranian government's disregard for women's rights and gender equality has been a significant source of discontent (https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/08/iran-protests-womens-rights-social-media-explainer/). Additionally, the role of international actors is complex. While some, like the US and Israel, have been accused of supporting the protests, others like the EU have urged restraint to avoid empowering hardliners in Iran (https://www.dw.com/en/iran-protests-eu-urges-restraint-us-and-israel-up-pressure/a-42019365). Furthermore, the involvement of groups like Anonymous in supporting Iranian opposition online is not necessarily indicative of a comprehensive external plot, but rather a global movement against censorship (https://www.rferl.org/a/iran_hackers_anonymous_cyberarmy_opposition_internet/2313350.html).",
