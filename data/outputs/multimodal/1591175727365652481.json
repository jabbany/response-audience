        "- T also plays a key role in building muscle and fighting fat. Healthy testosterone levels improve the body\u2019s ability to repair muscle tissue broken down during exercise, bettering your ability to gain and maintain muscle mass. As T levels decrease\u2014which they do gradually after about age 30\u2014a hormone called lipoprotein lipase (LPL) increases. Raised LPL levels result in more fat being stored as body fat, with less being used for energy. It\u2019s a double-edged sword: Lower T levels mean we store more fat, and higher body fat results in lower levels of testosterone.

        "- Estrogen plays a key role in male sexual health. It helps modulate sex drive, erectile function, and sperm production. It also helps keep the bones healthy. However, too much estrogen in males may cause problems. Symptoms of high estrogen in males include: breast enlargement, known as gynecomastia difficulty with erections infertility According to 2016 research Trusted Source , low testosterone and high estrogen can both increase erectile dysfunction independently of one another.

        "- The balance between estrogen and testosterone is important for a person\u2019s overall health. Too much or little of either hormone can cause health concerns. Low testosterone levels, or hypogonadism , is a common age-related health concern among males. Its symptoms include a reduced sex drive, erection problems, and a low sperm count. Some people worry that too much estrogen is the cause of low testosterone, but this is a myth. Estrogen and testosterone do not oppose each other.

        "- There is an association between serum testosterone and insulin resistance. 10 In other studies, testosterone levels are frequently low in men with type 2 diabetes, and the majority of these men have symptoms of hypogonadism. Obesity is associated with low testosterone levels in diabetic men. 13 As indicated above, androgen deprivation in men with prostate carcinoma leads to deterioration in insulin sensitivity and therefore increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. 14 A single-blind randomized study of testosterone administration in men with the metabolic syndrome and recent onset of diabetes established the beneficial effects of testosterone on blood glucose control over and above the effects on diet and exercise. 15 After 1 year, there were significantly more men in the testosterone-treated group who no longer met the criteria for metabolic syndrome. 15 In randomized control trials, testosterone treatment improved insulin sensitivity in middle-aged abdominally obese men, 16 although the findings have not been completely consistent. 17 Reference: https://www.nature.com/articles/hr201052 published on 2010-04-23 00:00:00",
        "- Epidemiological studies have established that low testosterone/low sex hormone-binding globulin can predict the development of the metabolic syndrome. 2 A number of studies have found an inverse relationship between the severity of the metabolic syndrome and plasma testosterone. 3 These previous studies agree with the results of Akishita et al. 4 Adiposity and hyperinsulinemia may suppress sex hormone-binding globulin synthesis and therefore circulating testosterone levels. 5 Furthermore, insulin and leptin have a suppressive effect on testicular steroidogenesis. 6 , 7 Thus, there is evidence that adiposity is a significant factor in lowering circulating levels of testosterone.

        "- 3 Supplements to Take Every Morning Vitamin D. In a study from Medical University of Graz, Austria, male subjects took either 3,332 IU of vitamin D per day per one year or a placebo. (The Institute of Medicine recommends 4,000 IU as the upper level of vitamin D intake.) Free testosterone levels increased significantly in the vitamin D supplemented group, but there was no change in the placebo group.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is partially correct. While it's true that testosterone is produced in the body by cholesterol derived from fat, and a high-fat diet can increase levels of free testosterone, it's not as simple as just increasing cholesterol intake. High estrogen levels, which can be caused by excess body fat, diet, and exposure to chemical estrogens, can decrease testosterone levels. Therefore, it's important to maintain a balanced diet and lifestyle. Also, vitamin D supplementation has been shown to significantly increase free testosterone levels. \nhttps://www.menshealth.com/health/a19535381/testosterone-boosting-breakfast-foods/\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323224",

        "- Serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and fasting insulin levels were higher and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels lower in men with lower serum testosterone levels. 10 In fact, men with prostate carcinoma who receive androgen ablation are prime examples of this phenomenon. In these men, there is increased total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

        "- Buy grass-fed, organic meats to avoid the chemicals\u2014even estrogen\u2014that much of our meat is full of in today\u2019s supermarkets. Men need some estrogen, but on such small levels that we usually have them naturally. Higher levels of estrogen caused by excess body fat, diet, and exposure to chemical estrogens can increase your chances of blood clots and prostate cancer, and can decrease your sex drive. High estrogen levels also correlate to low testosterone levels. Avoid soy, alcohol (except for red wine), and chemical estrogens found in plastics and some shampoo.

        "- Testosterone is produced in the body by cholesterol, which is derived fat. In a study in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism , men ate more than 100 grams of fat per day for two weeks. The results: They had less of a hormone that binds to testosterone, called sex-hormone-binding globulin. As a result, they had higher levels of free testosterone\u2014the only form of T that\u2019s ready to work on your tissue.
