        "- For decades, states have attempted to limit access to abortion after the first trimester by enacting restrictions on specific abortion methods. In the 1990s and early 2000s, most of the attention focused on attempts to ban so-called partial-birth abortion. Although they used varying definitions of \u201cpartial-birth\u201d abortion, the laws all banned the procedure except in the rarest circumstances.

        "- However, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a federal version in 2007 in Gonzales v. Carhart. That law, which applies across the country, bans \u201cpartial-birth\u201d abortion except when the pregnant person\u2019s life is endangered and does not contain an exception to protect the patient\u2019s health. Moreover, although the law does not include a precise medical definition of what is banned, the Court found the federal law\u2019s definition sufficient to pass constitutional muster and applied it to the dilation and extraction abortion method.

        "- A D&C may be used as a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure for abnormal bleeding. A D&C may be performed to determine the cause of abnormal or excessive uterine bleeding, to detect cancer, or as part of infertility (inability to become pregnant) investigation.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is somewhat misleading. While it's true that some states have enacted laws banning certain abortion methods, these laws primarily target the standard dilation and evacuation (D&E) method used in the second trimester, not dilation and curettage (D&C) procedures. D&C procedures are often used following a miscarriage to remove the fetus and other tissues, and can be crucial in preventing infection or heavy bleeding. These procedures have not been banned. \n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/bans-specific-abortion-methods-used-after-first-trimester\nhttps://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/dilation-and-curettage-d-and-c",

        "- More recently, states began enacting laws banning the abortion method most commonly used in the second trimester, standard dilation and evacuation (D&E). So far, all of these laws have very limited exceptions; they allow an individual to obtain an abortion using this method only when necessary to protect their life or in case of a \u201cserious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d The laws do not make an exception for serious mental health conditions.
