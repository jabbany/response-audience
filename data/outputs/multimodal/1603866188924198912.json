        "- Obviously something happened\u2014possibly a panic attack brought on by all the insistence that any exposure to fentanyl is potentially deadly. FOX 35 did revisit the story Wednesday with a vague \"some say\" approach, taking note that there is an \"ongoing debate between law enforcement and some in the medical community who say it's nearly impossible to overdose on fentanyl at crime scenes.\" This is not a \"debate.\" Police keep making claims that medical experts overwhelmingly say are not true.

        "- Sullivan tells WFLA the officer clearly overdosed, otherwise the Narcan wouldn\u2019t have revived her. She said the substance is believed to be fentanyl and that the agency sent it to an FDLE lab for testing.

        "- But when the claims being put forth by the police are easily countered by medical professionals, their efforts are completely undermined and they look less credible.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is misleading. While fentanyl is indeed a potent drug, it cannot be absorbed through the skin simply by touching it. The case of the Florida police officer is not a clear example of fentanyl's potential as a weapon of mass destruction. Medical experts have clarified that overdosing from fentanyl requires significant exposure, not just incidental contact. The officer's reaction could have been due to other factors, such as a panic attack.

        "- Although dozens of officers around the country have reportedly been treated for overdoses after being exposed to the drug fentanyl during traffic stops, health experts say you can\u2019t overdose on the drug by touching something like a dollar bill.

        "- This just isn't true. Add it to the pile of many, many examples of police attempting to convince the public that any possible exposure to fentanyl may be deadly. It does not simply pass through the skin when you touch it. As for the claim that the officer might have inhaled it, a study from the American College of Medical Toxicology and American Academy of Clinical Toxicology calculated that a person would have to stand next to a massive amount of fentanyl for two and a half hours to feel its effects.

        "- \u201cThe one case in which fentanyl can be absorbed through the skin is with a special doctor-prescribed fentanyl skin patch, and even then, it takes hours of exposure,\u201d said Daniel Colby, an assistant professor and co-medical director for the Department of Emergency Medicine at UC Davis Health.

        "- In other words, based on what we know about fentanyl exposure, it is extremely unlikely that what we saw was Bannick overdosing from inhaling fentanyl in a gust of wind.
