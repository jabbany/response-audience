        "- On April Fool\u2019s Day, Twitter tweeted that it was working on an edit button . Thankfully, it was just a joke. But things have gotten a bit more serious this week: Elon Musk bought 9.2% of Twitter for $3 billion and took a board seat . Then, he asked his 80.5 million followers if they would like an edit button. Reference: https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/05/twitter-edit-button-elon-musk/ published on 2022-04-05 15:23:17",
        "- Twitter Blue, the platform\u2019s subscription product, already has a feature that delays the publication of a tweet by a few seconds (users can choose for how long) \u2014 before that time period elapses, you can hit an \u201cundo\u201d button, which lets you go back and edit the Tweet before it actually posts. For issues as ordinary as typos, this feature enough should suffice. But if Musk\u2019s followers get their way and Twitter creates an edit button\u2026 now that\u2019s something we will actually lose sleep over.
