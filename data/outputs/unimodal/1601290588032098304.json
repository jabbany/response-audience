    "correction_response": "This tweet is partially misinformed. While it's true that Paul Whelan was discharged for larceny and other offences, he was not dishonorably discharged as the tweet suggests, but rather given a bad-conduct discharge (https://www.reuters.com/world/paul-whelan-ex-us-marine-jailed-russia-spying-charges-2022-12-08/). The tweet also misrepresents George Floyd's case. Floyd was accused of using a counterfeit bill, but his death was widely condemned and led to a global outcry against racial injustice and police brutality (https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-minneapolis-police-protests-idUKKBN23H2PX). The comparison between the two cases is misleading.",
