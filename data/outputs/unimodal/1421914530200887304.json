        "- Friday's order helps underscore the importance the new administration is placing on masks as part of that effort. Under President Donald Trump, the CDC was blocked from requiring masks on public transportation, but on his first full day in office President Biden signed an executive order requiring passengers to wear face coverings during interstate travel.

        "- The new order arrives at a pivotal moment in the pandemic. One year to the day since the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global health emergency, the U.S. has seen nearly 26 million cases and more than 436,000 deaths. And while two vaccines have already begun rolling out, troubling new variants from South Africa and the United Kingdom are raising growing alarm about whether health officials can prevent the virus from spiraling even further out of control.

        "- To help slow the spread of COVID-19, the CDC has mandated that face masks be worn on all forms of public transportation and extended a moratorium on evictions to prevent homelessness and unnecessary congregate living.

        "- The Public Health Service Act goes on to authorize quarantine of disease carriers and 'examination of persons reasonably believed to be infected.' Under the CDC's interpretation, those paragraphs, like the earlier list of disease control measures, are gratuitous and inconsequential. If the CDC is right, Congress might as well have stopped after the first sentence of this section, which authorizes regulations to prevent the interstate spread of contagious diseases. But the fact that Congress did not stop there suggests it did not mean to give the CDC the broad power the agency is claiming.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is somewhat misinformed. While the CDC has previously extended the eviction moratorium as a measure to control the spread of COVID-19, recent legal interpretations suggest that the CDC may have exceeded its authority in doing so. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, for instance, warned that he might change his mind about the legality of the CDC's actions if the moratorium were extended again. The CDC has stated that it does not plan to extend the moratorium further. Therefore, it's not a matter of the CDC choosing not to extend the moratorium, but rather a question of legal authority. \nReferences: \nhttps://reason.com/2021/07/08/if-the-cdc-can-impose-a-nationwide-eviction-moratorium-why-cant-it-impose-a-nationwide-vaccine-mandate/\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/01/30/962390180/cdc-issues-sweeping-new-mask-mandate-for-u-s-travelers-extends-eviction-moratori\nhttps://www.healio.com/news/infectious-disease/20210201/cdc-mandates-masks-on-public-transit-extends-eviction-moratorium-to-slow-covid19",
