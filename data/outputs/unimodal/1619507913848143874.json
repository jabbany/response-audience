    "correction_response": "This tweet is potentially misleading. While it is true that Israel has a history of striking Iranian targets and has recently conducted joint military exercises with the US, there is no official confirmation that the Israeli army will continue to strike strategic targets in Iran. The Israeli military has a policy of withholding comment on specific incidents, and recent US-Israeli exercises were not specifically oriented around Iran. Furthermore, while there is speculation about Israeli involvement in recent incidents in Iran, these are not confirmed facts. \nReferences: \nhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-us-wrap-up-largest-ever-joint-drill-in-message-to-iran/\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/blast-heard-military-plant-irans-central-city-isfahan-state-media-2023-01-28/",
