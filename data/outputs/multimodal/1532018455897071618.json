    "correction_response": "This tweet is potentially misleading. While Chick-fil-A's CEO did express opposition to same-sex marriage in 2012 and the company donated to anti-gay groups, their public stance seems to have evolved. The tweet from Chick-fil-A, Inc. suggests inclusivity, stating their food is for everyone, regardless of sexual orientation.
