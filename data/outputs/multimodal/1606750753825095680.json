    "correction_response": "This tweet is partially misleading. While the Israeli study cited does indeed find no increased incidence of myocarditis or pericarditis in post-COVID-19 patients, other studies have found a higher risk of myocarditis in COVID-19 patients compared to those without COVID-19. For instance, a CDC report found that patients with COVID-19 had, on average, 15.7 times the risk for myocarditis compared to patients without COVID-19. However, the absolute risk difference was small due to the low risk of myocarditis in both groups. It's important to consider all available research and understand that results can vary based on different study designs and populations. \n\nReferences:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35456309/\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7035e5.htm",
