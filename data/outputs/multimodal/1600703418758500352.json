It has risen by nearly 10 mm since January 2020 to a new record high this year. The past two and a half years alone account for 10 percent of the overall rise in sea level since satellite measurements started nearly 30 years ago.

While it's true that 2022 may not be the warmest year on record due to a rare triple-dip cooling La Ni\u00f1a, this doesn't reverse the long-term warming trend. The 10-year average for 2013-2022 is estimated to be 1.14\u00b0C above the pre-industrial baseline, compared to 1.09\u00b0C from 2011 to 2020. The last eight years have been unusually warm, exceeding 1.2C above pre-industrial levels. The long-term warming since the industrial revolution is attributable to increased concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases.
