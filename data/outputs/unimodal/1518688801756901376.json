        "- Tax policies that would substantially reduce the total racial wealth gap must be highly progressive and very heavy. The first point is obvious; progressive taxes hit those at the top of the economic spectrum, where the bulk of the racial wealth gap resides. The second point\u2014that progressive taxes need to be high to be meaningful\u2014is also an obvious truth, though more rarely acknowledged. Progressivity measures only the relative impact of a tax, not its total effect. For example, a tax of $1 on billionaires and $0 on everyone else is highly progressive, but it is far too low to affect the distribution of wealth.

        "- Over the period from 2014 to 2018 \u2014 as Musk's wealth grew by $13.9 billion \u2014 he reported just $1.52 billion worth of taxable income to the Internal Revenue Service, ProPublica reported. If his $455 million in taxes paid are compared to his wealth gains, they equate to what ProPublica calls a \"true tax rate\" of 3.27%.

        "- Many Americans live paycheck to paycheck, amassing little wealth and paying the federal government a percentage of their income that rises if they earn more. In recent years, the median American household earned about $70,000 annually and paid 14% in federal taxes. The highest income tax rate, 37%, kicked in this year, for couples, on earnings above $628,300.

        "- Perhaps the most efficient route is the newly popular proposal of a tax directly on wealth. Legal scholar Beverly Moran has discussed the potential of a wealth tax in the context of a reparations program. 9 Using data from Saez and Zucman on the distributional effects of the wealth tax plans , we can estimate the potential impact of such a policy on the racial wealth gap. The most aggressive plan considered by Saez and Zucman, proposed by Thomas Piketty in his 2019 book, \u201cCapital and Ideology,\u201d would impose a 90% marginal tax rate on billionaires, which would in essence limit fortunes to $1 billion dollars. 10 Though Piketty\u2019s proposed tax would touch barely 600 households, it would immediately reduce racial wealth inequality by $294 billion. Applying a similar policy at a lower threshold, $110 million in wealth, would reach about 16,000 households and would reduce racial wealth inequality by about a remarkable $500 billion.

        "- The notion that high-net-worth individuals use the tax code to their advantage to pay minimal income tax is nothing new. But ProPublica's reporting, which draws on more than 15 years of Internal Revenue Service data on thousands of the country's wealthiest people, sheds light on exactly how much Musk and others fork over in taxes each year \u2014 and how much income they actually report.

        "- Increasing the top capital gains tax rate to 43.4 percent alone would mean high-earning taxpayers may face tax rates north of 50 percent on capital gains when including state taxes. Taxing unrealized gains at death while still levying the estate tax further compounds the total tax burden on saving and investment, which may be the highest tax burden on capital gains seen in nearly a century.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is accurate in stating that Elon Musk paid an effective tax rate of 3.27% from 2014-2018, as confirmed by ProPublica's report. This is due to the fact that taxes are paid based on earned income, which doesn't include stock awards or the appreciation of investments. Musk's gains in net worth come mainly from his massive stakes in SpaceX and Tesla, and under the current federal tax code, he doesn't need to pay any tax until those assets are sold, or capital gains are realized. The tweet's call for a wealth tax aligns with the argument that progressive taxation is necessary to address wealth inequality. However, it's important to note that tax policy changes should encourage economic growth and opportunity, as suggested by the Tax Foundation. \nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-paid-little-in-taxes-2014-2018-propublica-report-2021-6\nhttps://taxfoundation.org/blog/joe-biden-estate-tax-wealth-tax/",

        "- A first step would be to reverse the slide toward regressivity that has characterized the American tax code in recent decades. Top marginal income tax rates have fallen from a peak of 92% in the early 1950s to 37% today. 6 The income tax rewards wealth over work by taxing income from ownership at much lower rates than income from salaries and wages. State and local taxes, moreover, are generally regressive . In sum, the tax code is only somewhat progressive for those between the poor and the upper-middle class, and tax rates actually go down for the very rich.

        "- Most analyses of the racial wealth gap, and most policy agendas to close the disparity, focus on the median household . And for good reason: The median captures the experience of the typical person, for whom housing and education costs are major factors in wealth accumulation. But as the data above demonstrate, closing the median racial disparity in wealth is not the whole task. Darity and Mullen use the total racial wealth gap as their measure of the contemporary economic disparity between Black and white Americans that has resulted from centuries of discrimination and exploitation. Taking into account the distribution of the total racial wealth gap, it is clear that racial justice requires progressive taxation.

        "- First, the budget proposes a tax on unrealized capital gains at death for unrealized capital gains above $1 million.

        "- Second, Biden also wants to tax the capital gains of millionaires at ordinary income tax rates, which would be levied at his proposed top marginal rate of 39.6 percent.
