        "- The interim director of the Department of Corrections, Tom Faust, has conceded that officials have struggled to keep contraband out of the jail. At an oversight hearing in March , Faust said he was focused on creating a \u201csafe, secure and humane\u201d environment after a correctional officer was charged with smuggling narcotics, knives and other banned items into the facility. That case was investigated by the Department of Corrections, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office and the FBI.

You can do it with drugs you can liquefy.\u201d The regional jail has already banned non-white paper and papers with drawings because of the problem. LSD has for decades been dabbed onto small pieces of slightly heavier weight paper, often with a distinctive logo, and then chewed by users.
