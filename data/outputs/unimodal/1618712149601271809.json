        "- In the 24 years of the Fair Tax proposal\u2019s existence, House Republicans have declined to hold a single hearing or mark-up session in committee, let alone a floor vote. The number of lawmakers sponsoring the bill has actually declined with each Congress, falling from a peak of 76 House Republicans in 2015 to 24 today. The Fair Tax effort is not gaining momentum but losing it.

        "- Like middle-income Americans, older Americans would likely also face a greater tax burden if moved to a regressive tax system, tax experts said. The move would shift when many retirees pay taxes from when they are currently taken \u2014 upon withdrawal from retirement accounts \u2014 to purchases. Current rates are typically less than 30%, so the change in how much they pay in taxes would depend on consumption, but it could add up.

        "- Advocates say a nationwide sales tax would \"simplify\" the tax code and create a fair, unbiased taxing system. Those against the idea say just the opposite \u2014 that it would unfairly tax lower-income classes and older adults who would otherwise no longer be paying income tax.

        "- But should the bill somehow reach the floor of the House, it is safe to assume that roughly 90 percent of Republicans will vote against it. In addition, the bill would stand no chance in the Senate, and the president has said he would veto it.

Buddy Carter of Georgia along with a group of conservative Republican co-sponsors, who claim the bill would simplify the tax code and make it more fair.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is somewhat misleading. While it's true that some House Republicans are proposing a national sales tax, it's important to note that this tax would replace the current tax system, not add to it. The proposal aims to abolish the IRS and simplify the tax code. It's also worth noting that the bill includes a monthly \"prebate\" for families based on size and income, which could lessen the impact on lower-income families. However, the greatest benefits would indeed go to those with the highest incomes. Lastly, the bill has little chance of passing in the House, let alone the Senate, and the President has stated he would veto it. \nReferences: \nhttps://www.fox29.com/news/national-sales-tax-whats-behind-some-house-republicans-proposal\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/fair-tax-act-republican-proposal-how-it-works/\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/national-sales-tax-house-republicans-grover-norquist/672810/",
