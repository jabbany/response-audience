Those 22.2 million job losses set U.S. employment back to 1999 levels.

Experts always caution that a president is not all-powerful in economic matters, since many factors beyond their control, from international oil supplies to changes in technology and demographics, can shape the health of the U.S. economy.

        "- During the first three years of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, the economy did quite well. The unemployment rate hit a 50-year low, income growth doubled, and the economic expansion he inherited grew into the longest in American history. But that all came to a shrieking halt when COVID-19 hit.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is partially correct but potentially misleading. While it's true that the U.S. did finish 2021 with 6.6 million more jobs than it started with, the claim of creating more jobs than any administration at this point in a presidency is not entirely accurate when considering percentage increase, which is a fairer way to compare data over 80-plus years. In this regard, 2021 did not set a record and was exceeded 10 times since 1940. Furthermore, the pandemic relief bills and the numerical rise in manufacturing jobs began under Trump's administration. Therefore, attributing all the job gains solely to the current administration might be misleading. However, Biden does deserve some credit for the manufacturing job gains. \nReferences: \nhttps://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/mar/02/joe-biden/fact-checking-joe-biden-scale-job-gains-2021/\nhttps://www.politifact.com/article/2022/nov/01/joe-biden-and-manufacturing-jobs-closer-look/",
