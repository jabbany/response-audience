        "- Lots of changes happen in your body during the cycle, including hormone fluctuations. About halfway through, one of your ovaries releases a mature egg. The egg goes to one of your fallopian tubes, where it waits to be fertilized by sperm. The lining of your uterus gets thicker, too. This prepares the uterus for implantation of the fertilized egg.

        "- Knowing when you\u2019re ovulating is key to tracking your fertility window and determining the best time to get pregnant. There are a few different fertility awareness methods, also called rhythm methods. It\u2019s best to use all three methods if you\u2019re doing natural family planning.

        "- In some cases, a woman doesn\u2019t make enough of the hormones needed to ovulate. When ovulation doesn\u2019t happen, the ovaries can develop many small cysts. These cysts make hormones called androgens. Women with PCOS often have high levels of androgens. This can cause more problems with a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle. And it can cause many of the symptoms of PCOS. Reference: https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos published on 2022-02-28 00:00:00",
        "- Your health care provider will ask about your medical history and your symptoms. You will also have a physical exam. This will likely include a pelvic exam. This exam checks the health of your reproductive organs, both inside and outside your body.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is potentially misleading. A period, or menstrual cycle, is a biological process that involves the shedding of the uterine lining when an egg is not fertilized. It is not merely a state of mind. Ovulation, the release of a mature egg from an ovary, is a key part of this process. If the egg is not fertilized, it is expelled from the body during menstruation. Transgender women, while deserving of respect and inclusivity, do not have the biological capacity to menstruate or ovulate as they do not have ovaries or a uterus. Therefore, they cannot have periods in the biological sense. However, they may experience symptoms similar to premenstrual syndrome due to hormone therapy. \n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/calculating-your-monthly-fertility-window\nhttps://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos",

In those cases, the uterine lining sheds and you get your period.
