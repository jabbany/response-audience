    "correction_response": "This tweet is misinformed. Pfizer, spelled backward as Rezifp, does not mean 'the Burner' or 'the Ravager' in Hebrew. The company Pfizer is named after its founder, Charles Pfizer, and has no connection to any ancient deities. Furthermore, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is officially named Comirnaty, a term representing a mash-up of the words Covid-19, community, immunity, and mRNA.
