        "- And since then, Biden's Education Department has acted on those plans. In October, the department announced reforms to PSLF, one of which included a a limited-time waiver through October 31, 2022, that will allow borrowers to count payments from any federal-loan programs or repayment plans toward loan forgiveness through PSLF, including programs and plans that were not previously eligible.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is somewhat misleading. While Biden did campaign on forgiving undergraduate tuition-related federal student loan debt for certain borrowers, including those from public colleges and HBCUs earning up to $125,000 per year, he did not promise to cancel *all* federal student debt for these groups. He pledged to cancel at least $10,000 of student debt per person and has since acted on these plans, with the Education Department discharging or in the process of discharging roughly $12.7 billion in student debt. However, Biden's approach to student loan relief began with improving, extending, or expanding existing programs, not widespread debt cancellation. \nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/student-loan-debt-forgiveness-biden-campaign-promises-education-department-2021-6\nhttps://www.npr.org/2021/12/07/1062070001/student-loan-forgiveness-debt-president-biden-campaign-promise",
