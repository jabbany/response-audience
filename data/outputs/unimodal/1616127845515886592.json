Lin, a forensic and general autopsy pathologist ( here ), told Reuters that fentanyl levels alone are not a clear indicator of the cause and manner of death, as the process depends on \u201cthe totality of the facts involving a particular case \u2013 not a simple number on a toxicology report.\u201d Reference: https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-george-floyd-overdose-death/fact-check-no-evidence-drug-overdose-was-main-cause-of-death-for-george-floyd-in-2020-idUSL1N3241XJ published on 2022-11-08 19:27:40",

        "- Baker ruled last year that Floyd's death was a homicide caused by \"cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression.\" In short, he found that Floyd's heart stopped beating and his lungs stopped working because Chauvin, 45, and other officers compressed him against the road in a way that starved his body of oxygen.
