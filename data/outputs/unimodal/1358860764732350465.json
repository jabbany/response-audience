        "- But it perhaps has been the new life that The Office found on Netflix that has transformed the show into the meme-generating viral juggernaut it\u2019s known as today. Although memes inspired by The Office were popular throughout the show\u2019s run, as one of the most-watched shows on Netflix\u2019s at the height of meme culture, it has become a true beacon of online humor.

        "- Memes are the fundamental unit of cultural evolution and have been left upon the periphery of cognitive neuroscience due to their inexact definition and the consequent presumption that they are impossible to measure. Here it is argued that although a precise definition of memes is rather difficult it does not preclude highly controlled experiments studying the neural substrates of their initiation and replication.

        "- And in 2017, it\u2019s clear that the doomsday crew vastly underestimated internet users\u2019 creativity. Increased mobility and access across platforms and communities has brought to the surface some of the funniest and weirdest content the web has ever known.

        "- But Chris Torres, the creator of Nyan cat , anticipated that the break from the old-school would be a good thing. \u201cThe internet doesn\u2019t really need to have its hand held anymore with websites that choose memes for them,\u201d he told The Daily Dot \u2019s Fernando Alfonso III in 2014. \u201cAs long as there is creativity in this world then they are never going away. This may just be the calm before the storm of amazing new material.\u201d Reference: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/12/a-unified-theory-of-meme-death/546866/ published on 2017-12-07 08:00:00",
        "- The word \u201cmeme\u201d was coined by Richard Dawkins in 1976. He argued that virality didn\u2019t just apply to infectious diseases, but also in anthropological settings. He defined a meme as any shareable cultural artifact that spreads through a culture like wildfire.

        "- Because as long as the absurd workplace comedy of The Office remains relatable to the modern world, people will keep watching and the memes will keep flowing. Reference: https://time.com/5763852/best-the-office-memes/ published on 2020-01-28 14:32:02",
        "- Today, memes have a specific connotation in our digital environment. What makes memes so special is their way of communicating attitudes, feelings and situations. Because of their popularity, it comes as no surprise that brands want a piece of this pie.

        "- A meme is a replicator, a cultural unit operating under Darwinian evolutionary principles analogous to a gene, but a distinct replicator in its own right (Dawkins, 1976 ; Goodenough and Dawkins, 1994 ). A meme in layman terms is a concept or idea, embodied by a word, a phrase, a riff, image, or gesture. A meme \u201cexists\u201d in the world of ideas and replicates by imitation.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is somewhat misleading. While individual memes may lose popularity over time, they don't have a set \"expiration date\". The lifespan of a meme can vary greatly, with some lasting years and others only a few weeks. This is often dependent on cultural context and trends at the time. For example, memes inspired by The Office have remained popular due to the show's continued relevance and popularity on Netflix. However, to effectively use a meme, it's important to be aware of what's currently trending. \nReferences: \nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/12/a-unified-theory-of-meme-death/546866/\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/07/19/more-than-a-trend-meme-marketing-is-here-to-stay/\nhttps://time.com/5763852/best-the-office-memes/",

        "- Watch your timing. Some memes have been around for years, while others are fleeting, like Kenneth Bone during the presidential debate .
