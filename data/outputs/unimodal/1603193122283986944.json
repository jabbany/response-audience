        "- Inflation in the United States was relatively low for so long that, for entire generations of Americans, rapid price hikes may have seemed like a relic of the distant past. Between the start of 1991 and the end of 2019, year-over-year inflation averaged about 2.3% a month, and exceeded 5.0% only four times. Today, Americans rate inflation as the nation\u2019s top problem , and President Joe Biden has said addressing the problem is his top domestic priority .

Those markets are down because investors are worried interest-rate hikes will slow the economy as central banks get aggressive in combating inflation.

        "- Figures 2c and 2d show that inflation in energy and in food, which are excluded from core inflation, are both elevated. Energy inflation is quite volatile; domestic energy producers faced very low prices early in the pandemic, and those producers may be waiting to see if price increases are durable before increasing supply. Food inflation is worrying and appears to be a global trend related to the pandemic among other factors.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is potentially misleading. While it is true that gas prices have been falling recently due to factors such as declining global fuel demand and a strong U.S. dollar, the overall inflation rate in the U.S. has been high and rising, with the annual inflation rate in the first quarter of this year averaging just below 8.0%. Furthermore, the inflation rate in May was 8.6%, its highest level since 1981. Therefore, the claim that annual inflation has been falling for the last five months may not accurately reflect the broader economic situation. \n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-gasoline-prices-are-finally-falling-why-2022-07-14/\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/06/15/in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world-inflation-is-high-and-getting-higher/",

Global fuel demand has been declining because of the high prices and the strong U.S. dollar making oil more expensive elsewhere.
