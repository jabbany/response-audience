        "- The Louisiana House Committee for the Administration of Criminal Justice advanced legislation Wednesday [May 4 2022] that would redefine personhood to begin at the moment of fertilization and would allow prosecutors to charge anyone who undergoes or provides an abortion with murder. HB813 by Rep. Danny McCormick (R-Oil City) would also allow the state to disregard any federal court rulings contradicting the new law and would grant the legislature the right to impeach and remove any state judges that attempt to block it from taking effect. [\u2026] Opponents of the bill said its broad scope would also criminalize in vitro fertilization, intrauterine birth control devices (IUDs) and emergency contraception as well.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is partially accurate. The Louisiana bill in question, HB 813, does not explicitly mention IUDs. However, by defining personhood from the moment of fertilization, it could potentially criminalize the use of IUDs, as they can prevent the implantation of a fertilized egg. The bill also allows for the prosecution of anyone who undergoes or performs an abortion on homicide charges. However, it does not specifically state that women using IUDs would be charged with murder. \nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/us/louisiana-legislators-advance-bill-classifying-abortion-homicide-2022-05-05/\nhttps://www.truthorfiction.com/louisiana-iud-bill/",
