        "- Our freight railroads are an important part of the nation\u2019s transportation system. This importance has been reflected in government policy since the 1860s, when the government gave thousands of miles of land to the railroads in order to encourage a network of transcontinental lines to the West Coast. More recently, freight railroads were the largest beneficiaries of $1.5 billion in economic stimulus grants awarded by the Department of Transportation and will also benefit from $8 billion in stimulus money being spent on upgrades for high-speed rail service. These public-private investments will help maintain a robust rail infrastructure to transport goods across the country.

        "- If Congress acts in this go-around, it will end talks between the railroads and four rail unions that rejected the deal Biden helped broker before the original strike deadline in September. Eight other unions have approved their five-year deals with the railroads and are in the process of getting back pay for their workers for the 24% raises that are retroactive to 2020.

        "- The main sticking points in the negotiations have been related to quality of life concerns. Workers have complained about the demanding schedules in the industry that make it hard for some of them ever to take a day off, and the rail unions have been pushing for the railroads to add paid sick time for workers. Railroads have refused to consider adding sick time because they don\u2019t want to spend more on these deals than what they have already offered, and the railroads say the unions have agreed over the decades to forgo paid sick time in favor of higher wages and strong short-term disability benefits.

        "- Without major improvements in rail service, more companies will decide to move goods by truck instead of freight rail, says Adriene Bailey, a partner at research firm Oliver Wyman\u2019s Transportation practice. This will lead to more congestion, more damage, and more accidents on the roads. It could also lead to higher costs, since rail is a less expensive way for companies to move products across long distances. Not to mention that if railroads lose more market share, the major rail companies will have to tear up tracks, lay off employees, and shrink their networks.

        "- But in return, we need to ensure that our small businesses and manufacturers that make use of the rail system are treated fairly. Unfortunately, for many businesses around the country, a lack of competition in the rail industry has led to rising costs and shrinking profits. These businesses, already struggling to survive in this tough economic climate, are forced to devote greater and greater shares of their operating expenses to cover the rising cost of rail service, instead of reinvesting this money into future economic growth.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is accurate. The US transportation system heavily relies on a functioning freight rail network, with railroads hauling about 40% of the nation's freight. A shutdown would indeed be devastating for workers and farmers across America, potentially costing the economy $2 billion a day. The President is indeed urging Congress to enact a deal that was reached at the bargaining table between union leaders and companies, as the tweet suggests. However, it's worth noting that the deal was voted down by four of the 12 unions representing about 115,000 workers at the freight railroads. \nReferences: \nhttps://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/why-congress-is-intervening-in-a-labor-dispute-between-railway-companies-and-freight-workers\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/29/us/politics/biden-rail-strike.html",

        "- The main reason for Biden to act now is that nearly every industry would be hurt by a rail shutdown and many commuters would be stranded as well. Railroads haul about 40% of the nation\u2019s freight, and the railroads estimated that a rail strike would cost the economy $2 billion a day . Also, rail would begin to stop taking shipments of hazardous materials and perishable goods up to a week before next Friday\u2019s strike deadline. That\u2019s why business groups in particular were urging Biden and Congress to act this week.
