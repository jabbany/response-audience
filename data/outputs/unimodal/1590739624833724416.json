        "- First, the data is old. The report was published in 1999, and the data it used were collected in 1996. That makes the statistics nearly 18 years old, which is practically ancient by social-science standards.

        "- People working minimum wage jobs full-time cannot afford a two-bedroom apartment in any state in the country, the National Low Income Housing Coalition's annual \" Out of Reach \" report finds. In 93% of U.S. counties, the same workers can't afford a modest one-bedroom.

        "- The Great Recession and the slow recovery have squeezed job prospects even for people who aren\u2019t homeless and have extensive work histories. Nationally, the unemployment rate is about 2 percentage points higher now than it was when the data was collected in the mid 1990s. So it\u2019s certainly plausible that homeless people today would be less likely to secure a job than they were back then, during an era of robust economic growth.

        "- Given each state and locality's minimum wage, the report finds that the average minimum wage worker in the U.S. would need to work nearly 97 hours per week to afford the average two-bedroom home.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is misleading. The claim that 40% of homeless people in the U.S. have full-time jobs is not supported by available data. A report suggests that of those homeless who reported working in the last 30 days, only 20% did so in a job lasting or expected to last at least three months. The rest worked temporary or day-labor jobs or sold personal belongings. Furthermore, this data is from 1996, making it outdated. The economic conditions have changed significantly since then, making it even harder for homeless people to secure a job. Also, even full-time minimum wage workers struggle to afford housing in the U.S., which could contribute to homelessness. \nhttps://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2013/dec/04/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-44-percent-homeless-people-are-/ \nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/14/full-time-minimum-wage-workers-cant-afford-rent-anywhere-in-the-us.html",
