        "- Acetaminophen use during pregnancy is considered safe, and an estimated 70% of pregnant women in the U.S. and 60% in Europe use the drug. Reference: https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/13904/Study-Long-term-prenatal-exposure-to-acetaminophen published on 2017-10-30 00:00:00",
        "- For instance, people use acetaminophen to reduce fever or to alleviate pain. It\u2019s possible that certain medical problems, which cause pain or fever in pregnant women, also increase the risk of ASD by themselves. Therefore, pregnant women with these medical problems are more likely to use acetaminophen, but it\u2019s the medical problem that increases the risk of ASD, not acetaminophen itself.

        "- The current near-ubiquitous use of acetaminophen during pregnancy is due in part to the widespread perception \u2013 even among doctors \u2013 that it has limited side effects and negligible risk. But a growing body of research suggests that the indiscriminate use of acetaminophen during pregnancy \u2013 especially for conditions such as chronic pain , low back pain and headaches \u2013 may be unwarranted and unsafe.

        "- Between the inconclusive studies about the risks of acetaminophen and the proven risks of using other painkillers or leaving fever untreated, it thus appears that the benefits of using acetaminophen outweigh the risks.

        "- Acetaminophen is an active ingredient in over 600 prescription and over-the-counter medications , including Tylenol. It is used by more than 50% of pregnant women worldwide and at least 65% of pregnant women in the U.S. Research suggests that acetaminophen is an endocrine disruptor and may interfere with the hormones essential for healthy neurological and reproductive development.

        "- However, prenatal use of the drug for 22 to 28 days for fever and infections was associated with a 6-fold increased risk for ADHD. Acetaminophen use for 29 days or more was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of ADHD regardless of why the mothers took the drug.

While some studies suggest a possible link between prenatal acetaminophen use and autism, the evidence is not conclusive due to limitations in study design and methods. It's also important to note that moderate use of acetaminophen during pregnancy, under medical supervision, is still considered safe.

        "- As we report below, some scientific studies have suggested that this might be the case. However, these studies have important limitations, therefore data on the topic is still inconclusive. Currently, moderate use of acetaminophen during pregnancy, under medical supervision, is still considered safe.

        "- Our study, based on an assessment of 25 years of research in the areas of human epidemiology, animal and in-vitro studies, concludes that prenatal acetaminophen exposure may increase the risks of reproductive organs developing improperly. We identified a heightened risk of neurodevelopmental disorders , primarily attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and related behaviors, but also autism spectrum disorder, as well as language delays and decreased IQ.

        "- In summary, some of the scientific evidence available so far suggests that acetaminophen use in pregnant women may be associated with ASD in children. But as we explained above, the studies that reported an association were limited in their design and methods, making the evidence less reliable, as ACOG and health authorities have pointed out.

        "- It\u2019s unethical to do experiments that could harm a human life, so to gain a better understanding of the direct effects of acetaminophen during pregnancy, we must rely on human observational and experimental studies to assess the possibility of causal connections. But to really get at these questions, we need human cohort studies that can precisely capture when and why acetaminophen is taken during pregnancy. Additionally, we would like to see research that gives us a better understanding of the biologic pathways.
