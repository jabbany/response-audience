        "- Federal agents were investigating a pickup truck found with weapons, ammunition and potential bombmaking material parked outside the Republican National Committee, according to two people familiar with the inquiry who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it. The truck, parked across the street from the party offices and near the entrance to a Metro station, contained rifles and shotguns and a mass of ammunition, these people said. Federal agents were still trying to determine whether that vehicle and its contents are connected to suspected pipe bombs found earlier in the day.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is misleading. While it's true that Ocasio-Cortez was not in the main Capitol building, she was in the Capitol complex and has expressed fear for her life during the riot. The attack was not limited to the dome, as the tweet suggests, but also included surrounding offices. Furthermore, potential bomb-making materials were found near the complex. The tweet's claim that the bombs were planted by Trump supporters is not confirmed, but the riot was incited by Trump's language. \nReferences: \nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/aoc-says-she-feared-her-life-during-capitol-riot-i-n1254042\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-capitol-history-factbox/factbox-bombings-shootings-beatings-u-s-capitols-history-of-violence-idUSKBN29D03F\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trump-supporters-storm-capitol-dc/2021/01/06/58afc0b8-504b-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html",
