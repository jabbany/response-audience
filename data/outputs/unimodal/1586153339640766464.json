        "- On a dynamic basis\u2014that is, accounting for the reduced size of the economy resulting from the tax increases\u2014we estimate the bill would raise in total about $308 billion in revenue net of tax credits over the next decade.

        "- The proposed 15 percent minimum tax on corporate book income is the most economically damaging provision in the bill, reducing GDP by 0.1 percent and costing about 20,000 jobs. While it now exempts accelerated depreciation , tax credits, and certain other items, the book tax remains a substantial tax increase on corporate income as it hits several other book-tax differences and limits the ability to carry forward losses. The excise tax on stock buybacks also eliminates about 7,000 jobs. Reference: https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/inflation-reduction-act/ published on 2022-08-10 18:18:22",
        "- The 55 corporations that paid no federal corporate income tax in 2020 spent nearly $450 million on lobbying and campaign contributions over the last three election cycles.

        "- ITEP\u2019s report does an excellent job explaining the policy details behind why many of these companies were able to avoid paying taxes. For example, companies game loopholes and write-offs like those for stock options, accelerated depreciation and maximizing special credits, such as those available for the energy sector.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is accurate but lacks context. It's true that in 2020, 55 corporations made $40 billion and paid no federal taxes. However, the Inflation Reduction Act's 15% minimum tax on corporate book income, which aims to address this, is only effective from 2023 and may not necessarily prevent tax avoidance. The Act also includes a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases and is estimated to raise about $308 billion in revenue over the next decade, but it could also reduce GDP by 0.1% and cost about 27,000 jobs. \nhttps://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/inflation-reduction-act/\nhttps://www.citizen.org/article/the-price-of-zero/",
