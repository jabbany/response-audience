        "- It was the fear about ozone depletion that mobilized one of the biggest environmental protection victories in recent memory. But while it\u2019s easy to see why blind sheep are bad, gradual changes like those associated with CO2 emissions are harder to quantify (and fear). Also, the public may assume that since the issue of the ozone hole was \u201cfixed\u201d so quickly, it will be just as easy to address the much more complex, slow-moving problem of climate change.

        "- The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is the landmark multilateral environmental agreement that regulates the production and consumption of nearly 100 chemicals referred to as ozone depleting substances (ODS). Since the ban on halocarbons, the ozone layer has slowly been recovering and the data clearly show a trend in decreasing area of the ozone hole \u2013 subject to annual variations.

Richard Farman, an atmospheric scientist who had been collecting data in Antarctica annually for decades, thought his instruments were broken when they began to show drastic drops in ozone over the continent. They weren\u2019t: The ozone layer had been damaged more than scientists could have imagined before Farman discovered the hole.

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) continues to enforce the Montreal Protocol on ozone-depleting chemicals, as there are still enough of these substances in the atmosphere to cause annual ozone depletion.
