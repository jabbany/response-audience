    "correction_response": "This tweet is misleading. The image of the blue owl is actually a doctored photo. The original photo, taken by Knut Eisermann, features a brown owl, not a blue one. The image has been manipulated to give the owl blue feathers and pink eyes. The original watermark has also been cropped out and the image flipped. The claim that this is a \"Philippines Blue owl\" or an owl from Madagascar is false. The original photo is of a Guatemalan Pygmy-Owl taken in Guatemala.
