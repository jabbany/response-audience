    "correction_response": "This tweet is partially correct and partially misleading. It's true that Donald Trump charged the Secret Service to stay in his hotels, as confirmed by the House Oversight Committee (https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/2022-10-17.CBM%20to%20Cheatle-USSS%20re%20Exorbitant%20Charges%20at%20Trump%20Properties.pdf). However, it's incorrect to say that Trump did not donate his yearly salary. He did donate his salary, but not to one specific cause or in one lump sum. Instead, he donated it in quarterly increments to various government initiatives (https://www.factcheck.org/2018/08/false-stories-revive-claim-about-trump-salary-donation/). The tweet does not provide sources for the claims about Trump's and his family's earnings, so these cannot be verified.",
