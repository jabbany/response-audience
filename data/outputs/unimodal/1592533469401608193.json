        "- To evaluate the effect of ivermectin in prostate cancer, we analyzed cell viability using MTT assays in AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP, C4-2, and 22RV1, AR-negative prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and PC-3, and nontumorigenic BPH-1 cells and human prostate primary stromal cells from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) [ 15 ]. As is shown in Fig. 1 , ivermectin markedly decreased the viability of all prostate cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is misleading. Ivermectin is widely available and used globally for treating parasitic infections in humans and animals. It's not approved for treating viruses, including COVID-19, and misuse can lead to sickness. Chemical castration drugs, on the other hand, are used under specific legal circumstances in a few U.S. states and countries for certain sex offenders.
