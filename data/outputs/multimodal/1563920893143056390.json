        "- I refer to that disgrace to the medical profession, Dr. Mehmet Oz. I haven't mentioned him on the site in a while, because really, why bother? Nothing that a person like me can say will derail that juggernaut of TV viewership, publicity, and money. Sweet, sweet money. Oz has a fan base of the credulous and the underinformed, and when he comes on his show talking about the latest all-natural extract that will Melt The Pounds Off or perhaps Fight Cancer, product moves off the shelves. And that's what's important, right? As long as the rubes reach into their pockets? Reference: https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/new-low-dr-oz published on 2018-06-07 00:00:00",
        "- What's set me off this time is this tweet from Dr. Oz's busy Twitter account. Update: it appears that it's been deleted! But check his website (for now) if you want to see it anyway. . . It's not about cancer per se , nor about dieting nor even about ways to as look young and untroubled as someone who's never heard of Dr. Oz. No, the latest bulletin from the frontiers of medicine is. . . astrology . Yes. \" For centuries ,\" says this egregious huckster, \" we have used astrological signs to examine our personality and how we interact with those around us. . . Discover what your astrological sign can tell you about your health \". Reference: https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/new-low-dr-oz published on 2018-06-07 00:00:00"
