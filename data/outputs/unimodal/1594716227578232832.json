    "correction_response": "This tweet is potentially misleading. While fentanyl is indeed a potent drug, the risk of secondary exposure leading to opioid toxicity is extremely low, according to the American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology. It would take 200 minutes of breathing fentanyl at the highest airborne concentrations to yield a therapeutic dose, not a potentially fatal one. Furthermore, many reported incidents of fentanyl exposure among police share symptoms of a panic attack rather than an opioid overdose. Unnecessary precautions may waste time in effective overdose response and perpetuate stigma against drug users. For routine handling of the drug, nitrile gloves and, in exceptional circumstances, an N95 respirator provide sufficient protection. \nhttps://healthandjusticejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40352-021-00163-5\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5711758/",

        "- The American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology issued a joint report in 2017 asserting the risk of fentanyl overdose via incidental transdermal exposure is very low, and it would take 200 min of breathing fentanyl at the highest airborne concentrations to yield a therapeutic dose, but not a potentially fatal one (Moss et al., 2018 ). In the very unlikely event of a substantial exposure by either means, the slow onset of opioid toxicity would allow sufficient time to detect and reverse it (Moss et al., 2018 ).

        "- For opioid toxicity to occur, the drug must enter the blood and brain from the environment. Toxicity cannot occur from simply being in proximity to the drug. Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5711758/ published on 2017-12-05 00:00:00",
        "- The position of the American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT) and American Academy of Clinical Toxicology (AACT), is as follows: Fentanyl and its analogs are potent opioid receptor agonists, but the risk of clinically significant exposure to emergency responders is extremely low. To date, we have not seen reports of emergency responders developing signs or symptoms consistent with opioid toxicity from incidental contact with opioids. Incidental dermal absorption is unlikely to cause opioid toxicity. Reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5711758/ published on 2017-12-05 00:00:00",
