        "- Quentin was only a fictional character, a creation of William Faulkner in two epic novels, \"The Sound and the Fury\" and \"Absalom, Absalom!\" But his anguish is so personal and haunting that generations of readers have come to regard him as someone real.

        "- Then came the idea of blocking the electoral votes, something first proposed by House Republicans. Cruz seized on the idea and, in the days before Jan. 6, repeatedly advertised his effort to so forcefully stand behind Trump\u2019s false fraud claims. Nine times on Jan. 5 and Jan. 6, he tweeted about his planned objection. Even after the Capitol had been breached, Cruz was tweeting about his brave stand in support of Trump\u2019s false claims.

        "- Nearly 60 years ago, when Faulkner was almost completely unknown except among his fellow writers and when, incredibly, all 17 books he had then published were out of print or almost impossible to find, Malcolm Cowley came to his rescue. He combed through the immense saga of Faulkner's fictional Yoknapatawpha County and produced \"The Portable Faulkner\" (1946), which has been brought back into print by Penguin Classics ($17) and remains to this day the perfect introduction to that world.

        "- I met other southerners who had found their ways to Quentin, and we formed a cult of sorts, talking incessantly about Faulkner. We came to look on Quentin as larger than southern: He was the universal outsider; he was youth clutching lost ideals in a changing world; he was anyone who felt the ground slipping beneath his feet. He was one of us. Reference: https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1985/07/21/faulkner-and-the-bridge-to-the-south/f7ac3ba1-8159-4b83-8259-6c2984264245/ published on 1985-07-21 04:00:00",
        "- House Democrats discussed impeaching the president in the wake of the siege on the U.S. Capitol, egged on by Trump during a rally hours earlier, on Friday. They circulated the draft of a single article citing 'incitement of insurrection' that could be introduced as early as Monday. A full House vote could be held as early as the middle of next week.

        "- But none could compare to Cruz in his efforts to leverage the fraud meme for his own political advantage. On Nov. 12, he appeared on Lou Dobbs\u2019s Fox Business show to deride mail-in voting as riddled with fraud. Within a week, he was boasting of how he\u2019d pressed the CEO of Twitter over the social media company\u2019s efforts to root out disinformation about the election results. A month later, he made the same critique of YouTube, challenging information distribution systems for curtailing the distribution of false information.

        "- In all of American literature there is nothing -- absolutely nothing -- to compare with the life's work of William Faulkner. From beginning to end his achievement is at an extraordinarily high level, sustained over nearly four decades, leaving us a half dozen indisputable masterpieces -- \"The Sound and the Fury,\" \"As I Lay Dying,\" \"Light in August,\" \"Absalom, Absalom!,\" \"The Hamlet,\" \"Go Down, Moses\" -- as well as many other books of singular merit. Simply and incontrovertibly, Faulkner stands alone.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is partially misinformed. While it's true that \"The Sound and the Fury\" is a novel by Faulkner, the phrase \"full of sound and fury, signifying nothing\" is originally from a soliloquy in Shakespeare's play Macbeth, which Faulkner used as the title of his novel. Therefore, Senator Cruz's reference to Shakespeare is accurate. \nReferences: \nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Sound-and-the-Fury-novel-by-Faulkner\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1985/07/21/faulkner-and-the-bridge-to-the-south/f7ac3ba1-8159-4b83-8259-6c2984264245/",

        "- The title of Faulkner\u2019s novel alone expresses Faulkner\u2019s concern with time. The Sound and the Fury takes its name from a soliloquy given by the title character of William Shakespeare \u2019s play Macbeth . In that soliloquy , Macbeth reflects on time and the meaninglessness of life: Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow Creeps in this petty pace from day to day To the last syllable of recorded time. And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle. Life\u2019s but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more: it is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.
