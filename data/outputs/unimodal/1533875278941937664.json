    "correction_response": "This tweet is potentially misleading. While it's true that Kyle Rittenhouse has expressed his intention to attend Blinn College and eventually transfer to Texas A&M, it's important to note that as of the date of the tweet, he has not been admitted to Texas A&M for Fall 2022. Additionally, a college official confirmed that Rittenhouse has applied but not yet enrolled for any classes at Blinn College. Therefore, his plans are not yet confirmed.
