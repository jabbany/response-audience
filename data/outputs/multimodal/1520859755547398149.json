        "- A highly detailed image shared on social media in 2020 showed the complex microscopic components that make up an animal cell. The image was shared on both Reddit and Twitter on Nov. 7, 2020, by Mahjabin Noroozi, a researcher with the Stanford Cancer Clinical Trials Office. At the time Noroozi described it as the \u201cmost detailed model of a human cell to date.\u201d Reference: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/image-animal-cell/ published on 2021-04-18 03:52:25",
        "- Some social media users likened the image to what might appear to be an aerial photo of India on Diwali night, a five-day festival of lights. However, a reverse image search revealed that the image in question was titled, \u201cCellular landscape cross-section through a eukaryotic cell\u201d and was created by Evan Ingersoll and Gael McGill for Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. , a private biomedical company that studies cell signaling.
