The decision to ban books or other teaching materials falls to the school districts, not the state itself.

        "- This list is fake. Florida passed a law in March that allows parents to review which books are required reading and books found in the library, and under the new law the parents can also contest materials. The law also requires the state to maintain a list of materials that school districts remove as a result of parental complaints. But that decision to ban books or other teaching materials falls to the school districts, not the state itself.
