        "- The language in the patent's abstract (also seen on page one here ) describes a contact tracing process that uses \"electronic devices.\" These would generate an ID number, and when in the proximity of another device, one or both electronic devices could transmit/receive information to/from the other electronic device. A score is then generated based on a plurality of such received IDs.
