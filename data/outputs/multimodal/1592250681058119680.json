Geopolitical conflicts have played out in esports, too, as the war in Ukraine prompted teams and stakeholders in the space to cut ties with Russian companies and organizations.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is potentially misleading. While Kyle Rittenhouse is indeed a controversial figure due to his actions during the Kenosha protests and subsequent trial, it's important to note that he was acquitted on all counts in November 2021. His Twitter verification comes from a paid subscription to Twitter Blue, not due to any inherent endorsement from Twitter. His engagement with social media, including plans for a video game and a YouTube channel, have been part of his public persona since his acquittal. However, these actions have further fueled the controversy surrounding him. \n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.newsweek.com/kyle-rittenhouse-pays-twitter-blue-check-conservatives-cough-1758500\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/06/23/kyle-rittenhouse-video-game-defamation/\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/kenosha-shooter-kyle-rittenhouse-starts-youtube-channel-about-guns-2022-10",
