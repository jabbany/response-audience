        "- Of the attribution studies included here, scientists found that human-caused climate change has altered the likelihood or severity of an extreme weather event in 80% of cases studied (71% made more severe or likely and 9% made less so).

        "- Scientists have published more than 400 peer-reviewed studies looking at weather extremes around the world, from wildfires in the US and heatwaves in India and Pakistan to typhoons in Asia and record-breaking rainfall in the UK . The result is mounting evidence that human activity is raising the risk of some types of extreme weather, especially those linked to heat.

        "- The scientific consensus might, of course, be wrong. If the history of science teaches anything, it is humility, and no one can be faulted for failing to act on what is not known. But our grandchildren will surely blame us if they find that we understood the reality of anthropogenic climate change and failed to do anything about it.

        "- The 928 papers were divided into six categories: explicit endorsement of the consensus position, evaluation of impacts, mitigation proposals, methods, paleoclimate analysis, and rejection of the consensus position. Of all the papers, 75% fell into the first three categories, either explicitly or implicitly accepting the consensus view; 25% dealt with methods or paleoclimate, taking no position on current anthropogenic climate change. Remarkably, none of the papers disagreed with the consensus position. Reference: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1103618 published on 2005-01-21 00:00:00"

    "correction_response": "This tweet is misinformed. Climate change is not a hoax, but a scientifically proven phenomenon. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states unequivocally that human activities are modifying the concentration of atmospheric constituents that absorb or scatter radiant energy, causing most of the observed warming over the last 50 years. Furthermore, a new field of climate-science research known as \u201cextreme event attribution\u201d has emerged, linking climate change with personal and tangible experiences of the weather. In fact, 71% of the 504 extreme weather events and trends were found to be made more likely or more severe by human-caused climate change. These facts are supported by numerous peer-reviewed studies and the scientific consensus. \nhttps://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1103618\nhttps://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-how-climate-change-affects-extreme-weather-around-the-world/",

Known as \u201cextreme event attribution\u201d, the field has gained momentum, not only in the science world, but also in the media and public imagination .

        "- The scientific consensus is clearly expressed in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Created in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environmental Programme, IPCC's purpose is to evaluate the state of climate science as a basis for informed policy action, primarily on the basis of peer-reviewed and published scientific literature ( 3 ). In its most recent assessment, IPCC states unequivocally that the consensus of scientific opinion is that Earth's climate is being affected by human activities: \u201cHuman activities \u2026 are modifying the concentration of atmospheric constituents \u2026 that absorb or scatter radiant energy. \u2026 [M]ost of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations\u201d [p. 21 in ( 4 )].
