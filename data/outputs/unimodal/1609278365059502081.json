        "- In a letter to Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer, the members emphasize that while the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) \u201cwas a Republican giveaway to corporations, preventing corporations from amortizing R&D expenses annually was one of the few provisions that helped level the playing field by increasing corporate taxes. Current proposals to reverse this provision would result in another massive tax break for corporations, and a $120 billion loss in revenue over 10 years for the U.S. government.

The unit stick prices for larger packs were sometimes lower than the unit stick price for a pack of 20, though not always. Where larger packs offered a \u2018quantity discount\u2019, doing so effectively meant under-shifting the excise tax on these packs because this tax is levied per stick.

They matter because actual inflation depends, in part, on what we expect it to be. If everyone expects prices to rise, say, 3 percent over the next year, businesses will want to raise prices by (at least) 3 percent, and workers and their unions will want similar-sized raises. All else equal, if inflation expectations rise by one percentage point, actual inflation will tend to rise by one percentage point as well.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is partially accurate. It's true that corporate profits have reached record highs, as evidenced by the surge in profits reported by domestic nonfinancial corporations and the oil industry [1][2]. However, attributing this solely to corporations using inflation as a cover to increase prices is an oversimplification. The increase in profits is also due to factors such as increased demand and undersupplied markets, as seen in the oil industry [2]. Furthermore, while some sectors, like the meat industry, lack competition [3], it's not universally true for all sectors. Therefore, the tweet could be misleading by implying that all corporations are price gouging due to inflation and lack of competition.\n\n[1] https://www.reuters.com/business/us-second-quarter-economic-growth-revised-slightly-higher-weekly-jobless-claims-2021-08-26/\n[2] https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exxons-record-smashing-q3-profit-nearly-matches-apples-2022-10-28/\n[3] https://progressives.house.gov/press-releases?ID=230126B6-9307-4132-BE94-68B24B066EE0",
