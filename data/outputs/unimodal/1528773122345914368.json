        "- \u201cI believe that the United States must help lead the way to a peaceful and prosperous future for both Israelis and Palestinians. We need to take a hard look at whether the sale of these weapons is actually helping do that, or whether it is simply fueling conflict.\u201d Reference: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/05/20/sen-bernie-sanders-introduce-resolution-disapproval-735-million-us-arms-sale-israel/ published on 2021-05-20 10:15:56",

        "- If a Democratic candidate wins the next presidential election, he or she will be a much less supportive president to Israel than was Donald Trump . This is particularly true for Bernie Sanders \u2013 the favorite of some prominent American Muslim antisemities \u2013 and Elizabeth Warren. Should Israel sit back and wait for whatever happens? This question should have been asked long ago. Yet, even if it is late in the game, that doesn\u2019t mean that our government should not take actions.

        "- If a Democratic president reverses some of Trump\u2019s measures it may be unpleasant, but not more. Moving the American Embassy back to Tel Aviv once it has been in Jerusalem is of secondary importance. Where Israel is truly vulnerable is at the UN Security Council. In his last days as president, Barack Obama acted against president-elect Trump\u2019s request and decided not to veto an anti-Israel resolution.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is misleading. The resolution introduced by six Democrats was not calling for an end to the State of Israel, but rather seeking to block a $735 million sale of precision-guided weapons to Israel. The resolution was a response to the conflict between Israel and Gaza's ruling Hamas group, with the lawmakers expressing concern about the potential for these weapons to fuel the conflict. The aim was to promote peace and prosperity for both Israelis and Palestinians, not to end the State of Israel. \nReferences: \nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-house-democrats-offer-resolution-blocking-735-million-israel-weapons-sale-2021-05-19/\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/05/20/sen-bernie-sanders-introduce-resolution-disapproval-735-million-us-arms-sale-israel/",
