    "correction_response": "This tweet is potentially misleading. While it's true that Elon Musk visited Epstein's Manhattan residence once, he has consistently denied having a personal relationship with Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell. Musk's visit was reportedly due to curiosity from his then-partner, Talulah Riley, and he declined Epstein's invitations to visit his island. The photo with Maxwell was explained as her photobombing Musk without his knowledge. There's no evidence to suggest Musk visited Epstein 12 times as the tweet claims. \nReferences: \nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/talulah-riley-denies-child-bride-ghislaine-maxwell-elon-musk-2020-7\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-denies-knowing-ghislaine-maxwell-2014-image-surfaces-questions-2020-7",
