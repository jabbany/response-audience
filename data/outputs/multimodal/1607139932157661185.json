        "- There is relatively little support among NATO members for sending arms to the Ukrainian government. A median of only 41% back such action. Despite Poles\u2019 general antipathy toward Russia, their concern about the military threat posed by Russia and their blaming Moscow for the current violence in Ukraine, only half (50%) want NATO to give arms to Kyiv. Americans are divided on the issue: 46% support sending weaponry, 43% oppose it. A majority of older Americans (56%) favor arming the Ukrainians, while more than half of younger Americans (54%) oppose it. And majorities in four of the eight nations are against helping arm the Ukrainians. The strongest opposition is in Germany (77%), Spain (66%) and Italy (65%).

        "- Since the Spanish Supreme Court last month convicted nine Catalan separatist leaders on charges of sedition, re-inflaming the demonstrations, many protesters here have come to believe that their fight for independence also represents something broader: a push against injustice and repression.

        "- BARCELONA \u2014 In a region battling to break away from Spain, pro-independence flags hang from wrought iron balconies.

        "- In terms of Europe\u2019s political and practical response to the war, all three main groups support the cutting of economic ties with Russia. But they do so by radically different proportions: in the Peace camp, 50 per cent back this but 37 per cent do not; in the Justice camp, the difference stands at 83 per cent to 11 per cent. Among Swing voters, it is 83 per cent to 7 per cent. Reference: https://ecfr.eu/publication/peace-versus-justice-the-coming-european-split-over-the-war-in-ukraine/ published on 2022-06-15 03:00:00"
