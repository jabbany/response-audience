    "correction_response": "This tweet is potentially misleading. The Ohio bill in question aims to prohibit teaching \"divisive concepts\" in schools, not specifically to teach \"both sides of the Holocaust\". The controversy arose when State Rep. Sarah Fowler Arthur, a co-sponsor of the bill, suggested that \"divisive concepts\" should be taught from multiple perspectives, which was interpreted by some as suggesting teaching the Holocaust from the perspective of German soldiers. However, she later clarified that her comments were misinterpreted and apologized for any misunderstanding. The Ohio House Speaker also criticized these remarks as inappropriate and uninformed. \nReferences: \nhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/ohio-lawmaker-says-holocaust-studies-can-be-taught-from-german-soldiers-perspective/\nhttps://www.dispatch.com/story/news/2022/03/23/ohio-house-speaker-criticizes-republican-lawmakers-holocaust-comment/7145188001/",
