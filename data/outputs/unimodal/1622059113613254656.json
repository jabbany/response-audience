        "- The balloon was initially spotted over Billings, Montana, on Wednesday. Defense officials said the Pentagon considered shooting down the balloon earlier this week but decided against it after briefing Biden. The decision was made in consultation with senior leaders, including Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Biden concluded that the U.S. would not shoot down the balloon because debris from it could cause damage on the ground, a Pentagon official said. Moreover, any information the balloon collects would have \"limited additive value\" compared with China's spy satellites.

In a statement Saturday, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said a U.S. fighter aircraft assigned to U.S. Northern Command successfully brought down the balloon at the direction of President Joe Biden. Lloyd said the balloon was being used by the People's Republic of China \"in an attempt to surveil strategic sites in the continental United States.\" Biden gave authorization on Wednesday to take down the balloon as soon as it could be done \"without undue risk to American lives under the balloon's path,\" Lloyd said.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is partially misleading. While it's true that Chinese spy balloons flew over the U.S. during Trump's presidency, there's no evidence that Trump hid this information from the public. The decision not to shoot down these balloons is not unique to Trump's administration. The same decision was made recently under Biden's administration due to concerns about potential damage from falling debris and the limited value of the information the balloons could collect compared to China's spy satellites. \nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/mattnovak/2023/02/04/yes-chinese-spy-balloons-flew-over-the-us-when-president-trump-was-in-office-too/\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/04/us-military-prepares-to-take-down-suspected-chinese-surveillance-balloon.html\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/suspected-chinese-spy-balloon-flying-over-united-states-us-officials-2023-02-02/",
