        "- But while almost all referendums have been on constitutional changes, not all constitutional changes are put to a referendum. House of Lords reform, the Human Rights Act, the Maastricht and Lisbon treaties were all passed by Parliament alone.

        "- Instead, I first assess the content of various proposals for a written constitution. I then problematise the process of constitution making by asking not whether the UK constitution should be codified, but by relating the constitution to the people as the authors and to the state as its object.

        "- Brexit could reverse this movement toward a codified constitution, returning Britain to its former unprotected state. But it raises the question of how long Britain can remain satisfied with such a constitution or whether Britain too should join most of the world\u2019s other democracies by adopting a constitution that is rigid and codified.

        "- Nonetheless, referendums have mostly been used to settle questions of an indisputably constitutional character. This applies to the three UK-wide referendums: European Economic Community (EEC) membership in 1975, electoral reform in 2011, and this week\u2019s EU poll.

        "- In a book published in 2009, The New British Constitution , I argued that Britain had begun the process of creating a codified constitution. It was pursuing such reforms as devolution: the granting of legislative power to newly devolved bodies in the non-English parts of the United Kingdom\u2014Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales\u2014and the Human Rights Act, which made the European Convention of Human Rights part of British law.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is partially correct. The UK does not have a codified constitution, which allows for referendums on constitutional reforms without a binding rule. However, while the UK was a member of the EU, it was effectively under a codified constitution - the constitution of the EU. This constrained both the government and Parliament. The question of whether the UK should adopt a codified constitution is a topic of ongoing debate. \nReferences: \nhttps://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/article/comment/referendum-and-british-constitution-strange-bedfellows\nhttps://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/08/brexit-means-britain-needs-a-constitution/\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34876878/",
