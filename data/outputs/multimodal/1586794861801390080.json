        "- On. Jan. 7, 2009, two weeks before Barack Obama took over the presidency, the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit in U.S. District Court under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, accusing the two men, as well as the New Black Panther Party and its leader, Malik Zulu Shabazz, of voter intimidation.

        "- Ranking Member Smith wrote: \u201cThe Department\u2019s continued refusal to provide any legitimate reason for the dismissal has only increased suspicions that race and politics played a role in this decision. Recent allegations from a former Civil Rights Division attorney confirm my concerns that the Justice Department has adopted a policy of race-based non-enforcement of federal voting rights laws. If these allegations are true, it means the Justice Department has become politicized and only an independent entity can effectively investigate this matter\u2026 Reference: https://judiciary.house.gov/media/press-releases/smith-calls-for-inspector-general-to-investigate-doj-handling-of-new-black published on 2010-08-03 23:59:59",

They were dressed in uniform and yelled threatening statements and racial epithets at poll watchers. One of the individuals was holding a baton. According to long-time civil rights attorney Bartle Bull, who was at the polling station that day, it was \u201cthe most blatant form of voter intimidation\u201d he had ever seen.

In fact, the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit against the New Black Panther Party and its members for voter intimidation. However, the case was dropped against all but one member, King Samir Shabazz, due to lack of prosecutable evidence.

        "- Under the Bush Administration, the Justice Department rightly filed suit against the New Black Panther Party and the two members. Despite having won a default judgment in the case, the Obama Administration abruptly dismissed several of the charges. No facts had changed. No new evidence had been found. The only thing that had changed was the political party running the Civil Rights Division.
