        "- The push for equal rights heated up in the 1920s after women gained the right to vote. Alice Paul , a suffragette, proposed the first version of an Equal Rights Amendment in 1923. The proposal was adopted and turned into proposed legislation by two Kansas Republicans, Sen. Charles Curtis and Rep. Daniel Anthony Jr., and was brought up during every congressional session between 1923 and 1971 without success.

        "- By 1970, the Equal Rights Amendment had been endorsed by four sitting presidents \u2013 Republicans Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard Nixon, and Democrats John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. The fledgling feminist group, the National Organization for Women , adopted the passage of the ERA in its 1967 Bill of Rights for Women and began staging massive demonstrations and lobbying politicians in the late 1960s and early 1970s in an effort to get Congress to pass the amendment.

        "- Feminists, for instance, are much more likely than non-feminists to say the country has not gone far enough when it comes to giving women equal rights with men (74% vs. 39%). Feminists are also more likely to say the bigger problem is people not seeing discrimination against women where it really does exist, rather than people seeing discrimination against women where it really does not exist.

        "- This piece is part of 19A: The Brookings Gender Equality Series . In this essay series, Brookings scholars, public officials, and other subject-area experts examine the current state of gender equality 100 years after the 19th Amendment was adopted to the U.S. Constitution and propose recommendations to cull the prevalence of gender-based discrimination in the United States and around the world.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is partially accurate. Women's rights are indeed not explicitly recognized in the US Constitution, as the Equal Protection Clause in the 14th Amendment prohibits states from denying any person equal protection under the law, but does not explicitly guarantee women's rights (https://theconversation.com/in-2019-womens-rights-are-still-not-explicitly-recognized-in-us-constitution-108150). However, the claim that 8 in 10 U.S. adults support adding the ERA to the Constitution may be slightly overstated. While a majority of Americans do support adding the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution, the exact percentage is not specified in the provided references (https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/07/14/most-americans-support-gender-equality-even-if-they-dont-identify-as-feminists/).",
