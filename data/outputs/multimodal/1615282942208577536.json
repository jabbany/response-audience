        "- Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov condemned the demolition of the monuments. \"This is a lie, a monstrous lie, because so many citizens of the Soviet Union died liberating Poland,\" he told reporters when asked about Nawrocki's comments. \"(It is) another attempt to fool the younger generation of Poles, feeding them lies and provoking hatred for Russians.\" Reference: https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/poland-demolishes-four-red-army-monuments-2022-10-27/ published on 2022-10-27 12:19:39",
        "- As the Red Army approached Warsaw (July 29\u201330, 1944), Soviet authorities, promising aid, encouraged the Polish underground there to stage an uprising against the Germans. However, the Polish underground, known as the Home Army , was anxious because the Soviet Union had already assumed direct control of eastern Poland and had sponsored the formation of the Polish Committee of National Liberation to administer the remainder of Soviet-occupied Polish territory.

        "- By allowing the Germans to suppress the Warsaw Uprising, the Soviet authorities also allowed them to eliminate the main body of the military organization that supported the Polish government-in-exile in London. Consequently, when the Soviet army occupied all of Poland, there was little effective organized resistance to its establishing Soviet political domination over the country and imposing the communist-led Provisional Government of Poland (January 1, 1945).

    "correction_response": "This tweet is potentially misleading. While it's true that the Red Army played a role in driving out the Nazis from Poland, many Poles believe that the Soviet Union replaced Nazi occupation with another form of repression. The Red Army was also accused of remaining idle during the Warsaw Uprising, refusing to aid the Polish resistance. Furthermore, the head of Poland's Institute of National Remembrance has stated that the Soviets brought a new enslavement, not freedom, in 1945. These perspectives challenge the narrative of liberation presented in the tweet. \nReferences: \nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/europe/poland-demolishes-four-red-army-monuments-2022-10-27/\nhttps://www.britannica.com/event/Warsaw-Uprising",
