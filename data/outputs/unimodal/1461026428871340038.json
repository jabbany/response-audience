        "- The increased earnings for low-wage workers resulting from the higher minimum wage would total $31 billion, by CBO\u2019s estimate. However, those earnings would not go only to low-income families, because many low-wage workers are not members of low-income families. Just 19 percent of the $31 billion would accrue to families with earnings below the poverty threshold, whereas 29 percent would accrue to families earning more than three times the poverty threshold, CBO estimates.

        "- Wage stagnation has been a subject of much economic analysis and commentary , though perhaps predictably there\u2019s little agreement about what\u2019s causing it (or, indeed, whether the BLS data adequately capture what\u2019s going on). One theory is that rising benefit costs \u2013 particularly employer-provided health insurance \u2013 may be constraining employers\u2019 ability or willingness to raise cash wages.

        "- The disconnect between the job market and workers\u2019 paychecks has fueled much of the recent activism in states and cities around raising minimum wages , and it also has become a factor in at least some of this year\u2019s congressional campaigns.

        "- In CBO\u2019s analysis, the size of the effects depends on the number of workers affected by the increase in the minimum wage, the changes in wages induced by the higher minimum, and the responsiveness of employment to those changes in wages. Effects would generally be greater if the minimum-wage change affected more workers, if it led to larger mandated increases for directly affected workers, if firms had more time to respond (for example, because the change was phased in over a longer period), and if the minimum wage was indexed to inflation or wage growth.

        "- Moreover, the increased earnings for some workers would be accompanied by reductions in real (inflation-adjusted) income for the people who became jobless because of the minimum-wage increase, for business owners, and for consumers facing higher prices.

        "- CBO projected the distribution of family income in future years and then combined those forecasts with estimates of the effects on wage rates, employment, business income, and prices. Effects on wage rates include increases in the wages of workers who would have earned slightly more than the proposed minimum wage in the absence of the policy. Losses in business owners\u2019 income and consumers\u2019 purchasing power would be partly offset by an increase in the productivity of workers who received higher wages. That increase in productivity might occur through various channels, such as a reduction in employee turnover. Reference: https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55681 published on 2021-04-05 12:00:00"

    "correction_response": "This tweet is partially misinformed. While it's true that wage gains have largely gone to the highest earners, it's not accurate to attribute inflation solely to the concerns of the wealthy. Inflation is a complex economic phenomenon influenced by many factors. The impact of unemployment benefits, stimulus checks, a $15 minimum wage, and labor shortages on inflation is not straightforward. For instance, raising the minimum wage could increase the income of low-wage workers, but it could also lead to job losses and higher costs for business owners. Furthermore, not all the increased earnings from a higher minimum wage would go to low-income families. Therefore, it's an oversimplification to say that these factors are causing inflation due to the fears of the rich. \n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/\nhttps://www.cbo.gov/publication/55681\nhttps://www.cbo.gov/publication/44995",

        "- Meanwhile, wage gains have gone largely to the highest earners. Since 2000, usual weekly wages have risen 3% (in real terms) among workers in the lowest tenth of the earnings distribution and 4.3% among the lowest quarter. But among people in the top tenth of the distribution, real wages have risen a cumulative 15.7%, to $2,112 a week \u2013 nearly five times the usual weekly earnings of the bottom tenth ($426).

        "- But despite the strong labor market, wage growth has lagged economists\u2019 expectations . In fact, despite some ups and downs over the past several decades, today\u2019s real average wage (that is, the wage after accounting for inflation) has about the same purchasing power it did 40 years ago. And what wage gains there have been have mostly flowed to the highest-paid tier of workers.

        "- By boosting the income of low-wage workers who have jobs, a higher minimum wage would raise their families\u2019 real income (that is, income adjusted to remove the effects of inflation), lifting some of those families out of poverty. However, income would fall for some families because other workers would not be employed and because business owners would have to absorb at least some of the higher costs of labor. For those reasons, a minimum-wage increase would cause a net reduction in average family income. Reference: https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55681 published on 2021-04-05 12:00:00",
