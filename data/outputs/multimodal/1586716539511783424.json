        "- Musk\u2019s reversal may be explained by the fact that his previous criticism was part of his feud with the Saudi fund because they had failed to publicly back his bid to take Tesla, his car company, private. In a text message to the head of the fund, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, in August 2018, Musk said that due to the fund\u2019s lack of vocal support, \u201cWe cannot work together.\u201d That was before Khashogg i\u2019s death. Apparently, money, not the murder of a journalist, was Musk\u2019s main beef with the Saudis.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is partially misleading. While it's true that Saudi Arabia sentenced a dual US-Saudi citizen to 16 years in prison for critical tweets, the claim that the Saudis partnered with Elon Musk to buy Twitter is not entirely accurate. Saudi Arabia's Kingdom Holding Company and the private office of Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal have maintained their existing ownership of Twitter shares valued at $1.89 billion after Elon Musk's takeover. They did not buy Twitter with Musk, but rather kept their existing stake. As for the question of promoting free speech, it's worth noting that Saudi Arabia has a history of repressing speech and imprisoning critics. Musk, on the other hand, has expressed a desire for fewer limits on Twitter content. \n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/10/elon-musk-free-speech-absolutist-is-silent-about-his-saudi-partners/\nhttps://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/saudis-kingdom-holding-company-maintain-twitter-stake-2022-10-28/",
