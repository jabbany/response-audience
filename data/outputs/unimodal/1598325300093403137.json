    "correction_response": "This tweet is accurate but slightly misleading. Former police chief Jerry Trabona and former councilman Kris Hart were indeed sentenced to one year in prison for violating federal election laws in a vote-buying scheme. However, the tweet fails to mention that they are no longer in office and that this scheme took place during the 2016 elections. Also, it's worth noting that two other individuals, Calvin Batiste and Louis Ruffino, were also involved and have pleaded guilty, but their sentencing will occur at a later date. \nReferences: \nhttps://www.klfy.com/louisiana/former-louisiana-police-chief-city-council-member-sentenced-in-vote-buying-scheme/\nhttps://www.wafb.com/2022/11/30/three-sentenced-including-former-police-chief-city-council-member-2016-vote-buying-case/",
