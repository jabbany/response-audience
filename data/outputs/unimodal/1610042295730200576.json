        "- \u201cThe Affordable Insulin Now Act will limit out-of-pocket insulin costs to $35 per month for millions,\u201d said Rep. Pascrell . \u201cOver seven million Americans use insulin to stay alive. But the average insulin costs rose 54 percent from 2014 to 2019. When insulin was discovered, Warren Harding was the President and the New York Giants won the World Series. We didn\u2019t even have television. For a drug discovered over 100 years ago, a $1,000 price tag for a single vial of insulin is a national disgrace. This bill will lower costs. It will save lives. If we can\u2019t improve the lives of millions, why the hell are we here?\u201d Reference: https://pascrell.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=5083 published on 2022-04-01 00:00:00",

        "- Hudson\u2019s office said the congressman\u2019s March 31 vote is in line with other efforts to reduce insulin prices. Jordan Shaw, one of Hudson\u2019s advisors, said Hudson co-sponsored the Lower Costs, More Cures Act of 2019, or H.R. 19, which would have capped the cost of insulin for some Medicare customers.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is partially misleading. While it's true that a majority of Republicans voted against the Affordable Insulin Now Act, it's not accurate to say \"every single Republican\" did. In fact, 12 Republicans, including Richard Hudson, voted in favor of the bill. The act caps insulin co-payments for insured Americans at $35 a month, but it doesn't help the uninsured. It's also worth noting that this is the second time the House has voted to cap the price of insulin at $35. \nReferences: \nhttps://pascrell.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=5083\nhttps://hudson.house.gov/media/in-the-news/nc-democrat-falsely-claims-republican-richard-hudson-opposed-insulin-price-cap",
