        "- CBD and THC As the legal use of hemp and other cannabis products grows in the United States, consumers are becoming more curious about their options. This includes cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), two natural compounds found in plants of the Cannabis genus.

        "- In the United States, cannabis-related laws are evolving regularly. Technically, CBD is still considered a Schedule I drug under federal law. Hemp has been removed from the Controlled Substances Act, but the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) still classify CBD as a Schedule I drug. As of March 2023, 37 states , as well as D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, have legalized the use of medical cannabis with high levels of THC. Another 10 states allow access to limited amounts of low THC cannabis or CBD oil. The cannabis may need to be recommended by a licensed physician.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is accurate. The snacks shown in the images are indeed laced with THC, the main psychoactive compound in cannabis. There have been incidents where children have mistakenly consumed these snacks, leading to hospitalization due to the high THC content. It's important to note that while medical cannabis is legal in some states, it should be kept out of reach of children. The packaging of these products can be misleading, as they resemble popular snacks, which has led to concerns from companies like Frito-Lay. \n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/cbd-vs-thc\nhttps://www.latintimes.com/toddler-hospitalized-after-eating-marijuana-laced-snack-looked-cheetos-479853",

It\u2019s also available in oils, edibles, tinctures , capsules, and more. Reference: https://www.healthline.com/health/cbd-vs-thc published on 2020-07-20 01:49:00",
        "- Cannabinoids like THC and CBD are stored in the body\u2019s fat. They can show up Trusted Source on drug tests for several days or weeks after you use them. Not every drug test can detect CBD, but CBD-sensitive tests are available. Most standard drug tests look for chemicals related to THC, so THC or cannabis use might appear on a screening. Likewise, hemp can produce some THC in addition to CBD, so a test could be positive for THC even if you haven\u2019t used it. Products that claim to be THC-free may not actually be free of THC, so if you\u2019re getting a drug test, avoid any CBD or THC products.
