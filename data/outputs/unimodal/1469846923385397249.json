        "- Runaways may not always be classified as missing children, making it difficult to quantify the problem. Many runaways are not considered missing because guardians and/or parents know the whereabouts of the youth. Youth who run away may stay with friends or other family members. 1 , 20 In addition, some runaways may not be reported missing because the guardians and/or parents are not looking for them. There is a small category of children who are permanently abandoned and are often not included in data because they may not be reported as missing. 1 Reference: https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/145/2/e20193752/68225/Runaway-Youth-Caring-for-the-Nation-s-Largest published on 2020-02-01 00:00:00"

    "correction_response": "This tweet is potentially misleading. While it's true that many children go missing each year, the number cited includes multiple reports for the same child and runaways who may not be considered missing because their guardians know their whereabouts. Furthermore, media coverage of missing children is not guaranteed and often focuses on cases deemed newsworthy or those that generate high engagement on social media. Therefore, it's not accurate to suggest that the media is ignoring the issue. \nReferences: \nhttps://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/145/2/e20193752/68225/Runaway-Youth-Caring-for-the-Nation-s-Largest\nhttps://theconversation.com/rolling-media-coverage-of-missing-persons-cases-can-add-to-the-trauma-for-all-families-left-behind-172487",

        "- The Runaway Safeline, (1\u2013800-RUNAWAY), formerly known as the National Runaway Switchboard, is a federally funded national resource that provides services to youth and their families ( https://www.1800runaway.org/ ). The Safeline allows runaway and homeless youth or their parents to call for assistance or guidance; attain 24-hour referrals to community resources, including shelter, food banks, legal assistance, and social services agencies; and seek crisis intervention counseling. 20 The Safeline handled more than 70 000 calls and electronic contacts in 2017. 22 Of those contacts, 31% of contacts were about youth who were contemplating running away, 16% were about youth who had run away, 5% were about youth asked to leave home or prevented from returning home (thrownaway), and 9% were about youth experiencing homelessness. Approximately three-fourths of the calls came from the affected youth. 22 Reference: https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/145/2/e20193752/68225/Runaway-Youth-Caring-for-the-Nation-s-Largest published on 2020-02-01 00:00:00",

        "- Each report of a missing child made to law enforcement is required by federal law to be entered into the Federal Bureau of Investigation National Crime Information Center (National Center for Missing and Exploited Children [NCMEC]). 21 Some of the reports may be regarding the same child because a report can be made each time a child is missing. In 2017, 464 000 reports were made into this database. One role of the NCMEC, the national clearinghouse and resource center for missing and exploited children, is to help with finding these children. In 2017, the NCMEC assisted with more than 27 000 cases, including 25 000 runaways ( missingkids.org ). 21 Reference: https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/145/2/e20193752/68225/Runaway-Youth-Caring-for-the-Nation-s-Largest published on 2020-02-01 00:00:00",
