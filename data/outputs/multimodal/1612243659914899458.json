        "- Hire Survivors Hollywood started as a hashtag in late 2017. Masse started using #HireSurvivorsHollywood, and speaking up about retaliation, after she was told she was being blacklisted in the business for speaking against Weinstein. The initiative was formally launched in early 2020, after Masse spoke on a panel with other survivors at the Athena Film Festival.

        "- \u201cHistorically, survivors have always been concerned about naming their abusers publicly, but those concerns are intensified after this verdict, and that\u2019s in large part because Amber Heard never did name Johnny Depp publicly as her abuser,\u201d she said.

        "- The defamation trial between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard took on a cultural significance most people were unprepared for. It made daily headlines, dominated social media platforms, and resulted in the \"global humiliation\" of a woman who alleged abuse, an ignominy Depp promised in a 2016 text after Heard secured a restraining order against him.

    "correction_response": "This tweet is potentially misleading. While Amber Heard has been a public figure representing domestic abuse, she was successfully sued by Johnny Depp for defamation, and the verdict was seen as a setback for domestic violence victims. This has led to intense scrutiny and doubt about Heard's claims of abuse, with some survivors even saying they thought she was lying, potentially discrediting other survivors. Therefore, celebrating Heard might be seen as controversial given these circumstances. \nReferences: \nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2022/06/02/after-amber-heard-we-asking-wrong-questions-metoo/7487231001/\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/amber-heard-verdict-blasted-setback-women-domestic-violence-survivors-rcna31752",
