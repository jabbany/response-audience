        "- Investigators say Moore in May 2021 initially signed an agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to distribute COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination cards from the plastic surgery practice. Moore and Burgoyne then ordered \u201chundreds\u201d of COVID-19 vaccine doses from the CDC between May 2021 and September 2022, court documents state.

        "- According to the indictment , which was unsealed on January 17, Moore, Burgoyne, Flores, and Andersen set up a scheme in which the plastic surgery practice became a legitimate COVID-19 vaccine provider. Moore signed the government's COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement in May 2021, allowing the site to receive bona fide, government-purchased COVID-19 doses. Between October 15, 2021, and September 6, 2022, the group ordered around 2,200 vaccine doses from the federal government.

        "- \"By allegedly falsifying vaccine cards and administering saline shots to children instead of COVID-19 vaccines, not only did this provider endanger the health and well-being of a vulnerable population, but also undermined public trust and the integrity of federal health care programs,\u201d Curt Muller, special agent in charge with the Department of Health and Human Services for the Office of the Inspector General, said in a statement.

        "- Burgoyne would then upload the names of all purported vaccine recipients to the Utah Statewide Immunization Information System \u2014 falsely reporting that the practice had administered 1,937 doses of vaccine, including 391 pediatric Pfizer doses. That amounts to about $28,028 worth of actual vaccine doses, which the defendants allegedly drew from bottles with a syringe and squirted down a drain, documents state.
