    "correction_response": "This tweet is misleading. While it's true that the U.S. Supreme Court, with Justice Clarence Thomas authoring the ruling, recently struck down a New York state law requiring a special need for carrying a weapon, it's incorrect to directly attribute this tragic incident to that ruling. The incident occurred very shortly after the ruling, and it's unlikely that the ruling had an immediate impact on gun violence. Furthermore, New York has tightened its gun laws in response to high-profile mass shootings, and the overall number of shootings in the city is down year-on-year. The Mayor of New York has also emphasized that illegal guns are too accessible, indicating that the issue may be more complex than the tweet suggests. \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/06/30/woman-shot-upper-east-side-stroller-baby/\nhttps://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-supreme-court-strikes-down-new-york-limits-concealed-handguns-2022-06-23/\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/mother-pushing-stroller-shot-and-killed-upper-east-side/",
